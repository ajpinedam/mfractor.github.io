Visual Studio for Mac support is under active development and is expected 1st of July 2017.\n\n\nDoes MFractor support Visual Studio Windows?\n\n\nMFractor \ndoes not\n support Visual Studio Windows. This is on our roadmap for the future but we have no concrete timeline. A news announcement will be published when we commence work on MFractor for Visual Studio Windows.\n\n\nHow do I get started using MFractor?\n\n\nMFractor does a lot so it may take a little while to learn its ins and outs. If you'd like to learn how to best use it, you have a few options:\n\n\n\n\nGet started by reading the \nXamarin.Forms Quickstart\n and \nXamarin.Android Quickstart\n; these are a quick overview of the most used features.\n\n\nRead the in-depth docs for both Xamarin.Forms and Xamarin.Android (see the menu to the left). Each article covers a feature in-depth and fully explains how to use it.\n\n\nDrop into the \n#mfractor Xamarin Slack sub-channel\n and start chatting to me (Matthew Robbins). I'm happy to answer any questions you have.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I file a bug report?\n\n\nIf you notice a bug while you are using MFractor, please file a bug report by taking the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nPrepare a short 2-3 sentence description of the bug, the steps you took that triggered it and the symptoms of the bug.\n\n\nCopy MFractors version information by opening the \nAbout\n dialog (\nHelp\n -\n \nMFractor\n -\n \nAbout\n) and click \nCopy Build Details Into Clipboard\n.\n\n\nEmail the description and build version to \nhello@mfractor.com\n.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I install or update the Android SDK meta-data bundle?\n\n\nIf you'd like to activate tooltips and go-to declaration support for Android SDK resources (for example: \n@android:string/my_string\n), you can install MFractors Android SDK meta-data.\n\n\nTo install, go to the \nHelp\n main menu, select \nMFractor\n and then \nInstall Android SDK Meta-Data\n:\n\n\n\n\nYou will be prompted to confirm the installation; installing the meta-data will wipe any existing installation!\n\n\n\n\nMFractor will then download and install the latest meta-data bundle:\n\n\n\n\nWhen the installation has completed, just close the installation success message; there is no need to restart Visual Studio Mac.\n\n\nWhat is the .droidres folder?\n\n\nThe \n.droidres\n folder contains the meta-data that's generated when MFractor indexes your Android projects. This meta-data is used to power resource tooltips and resource go-to declaration for Android projets.\n\n\nIt is safe to delete whenever you want however some features for Android development won't work correctly without it.\n\n\nShould I check .droidres into source control?\n\n\nNo, you should not check \n.droidres\n into your source control.\n\n\nIf you are using git, append the following text to the end of your \n.gitignore\n to exclude \n.droidres\n:\n\n\n# MFractor's Android meta-data cache\n*.droidres/",

This is accomplished through \ndata binding\n; properties on a view are bound to properties on a backing object through binding mechanisms allowing two-way data transfer between the UI and application logic. For a full tutorial on Mvvm architecture, please Microsofts \nThe Mvvm Pattern\n article.\n\n\nWhen working with Xaml, we can specify a binding context to activate binding expression analysis and a variety of BindingContext specific refactorings.\n\n\nWe can specify a binding context \nexplicitly\n via in inline Xaml expression or \nimplicitly\n through the use of common MVVM naming conventions.\n\n\nExplicit Binding Context Resolution\n\n\nIn Xamarin.Forms, all views have the property \nBindingContext\n; this specifies the object that a view should data-bind with. When coding with Xaml, we can use the \nx:Static\n markup extension to reference a static C# property and explicitly provide an instance of a C# class as the binding context:\n\n\n \nEntry BindingContext=\n{x:Static local:MyStaticClass.MyStaticProperty}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is known as the \nView Model Locator Pattern\n. We implement a static class named \nViewModelLocator\n and use a static, readonly property to return an instance of the object we want our Xaml view to data-bind with. Historically the \nView Model Locator Pattern\n has been used to provide design time data to the Xamarin.Forms Xaml previewer. For a deeper insight into this pattern, read James Montemagnos excellent \nView Model Locator\n article.\n\n\nFor example, given a Xaml page named \nLoginPage\n, we can explicitly provide an instance of \nLoginViewModel\n as the binding context like so:\n\n\nViewModelLocator.cs\n\n\npublic namespace MyApp\n{\n  public static class ViewModelLocator\n  {\n      public static readonly LoginViewModel LoginViewModel = new LoginViewModel();\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml\n\n\nContentPage\n  xmlns:local=\nclr-namespace:MyApp;assembly=MyApp\n\n  BindingContext=\n{x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor begins analysis on LoginPage.xaml it will check if any \nBindingContext\n properties have been assigned to. As the root \nContentPage\n assigns a binding context, it will inspect the value component of the \nBindingContext\n attribute, check if it is a Xaml expression and then evaluate it for the return type.\n\n\nFor the \n{x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel}\n expression, MFractor will resolve the \nViewModelLocator\n class in the \nlocal\n namespace and then grab the C# type of the \nLoginViewModel\n property. This informs MFractor that the page will be bound to a \nLoginViewModel\n instance and therefore to analyse all \nBinding\n expressions against the \nLoginViewModel\n type.\n\n\nExplicit binding context resolution will also work when referencing another element using \nx:Reference\n expressions. For example, we can bind the on/off state of a switch to the visibility of a text label like so:\n\n\n  \nSwitch x:Name=\nmySwitch\n /\n\n  \nLabel BindingContext=\n{x:Reference mySwitch}\n IsVisible=\n{Binding IsToggled}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor analyses the \n{Binding IsToggled}\n expression, it will evaluate the \n{x:Reference mySwitch}\n expression and use the type of mySwitch as the BindingContext (Xamarin.Forms.Switch).\n\n\nImplicit Binding Context Resolution\n\n\nIn addition to explicit binding context resolution, MFractor will attempt to infer the relationship between your view models and xaml views via \nimplicit binding context resolution\n. This is done by looking for classes and Xaml views that share a common naming convention.\n\n\nLet's consider the following files:\n\n\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml\n - The xaml view.\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n - The code behind for the xaml view.\n\n\nLoginViewModel\n - The a C# class that is the view model for the LoginPage view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause these pages share the prefix \nLogin\n and each has a distinct file extension or suffix, we can infer the following relationships:\n\n\n\n\nThe \n.xaml\n extension denotes that \nLoginPage.xaml\n is a xaml view.\n\n\nThe \n.xaml.cs\n extension and the \nLoginPage\n component denotes that \nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n is the code behind implementation \nLoginPage\n view.\n\n\nThe \nViewModel\n suffix implies that \nLoginViewModel\n is a view model. When \nViewModel\n is removed from \nLoginViewModel\n and \nPage\n is removed from \nLoginPage\n, the \nLogin\n component implies that the \nLoginViewModel\n is related to the \nLoginPage\n xaml view and it's code behind file.\n\n\n\n\nMFractor uses these common naming conventions of Page.xaml, Page.xaml.cs and ViewModel to decide that \nLoginViewModel\n will probably be the BindingContext for \nLoginPage\n. It will then\n\n\nThe following suffixes are supported for Xaml views:\n\n\n\n\nPage\n: EG LoginPage.xaml \n-\n LoginViewModel\n\n\nView\n: EG LoginView.xaml \n-\n LoginViewModel\n\n\n\n\nExplicit binding context resolution will \nalways\n override implicit binding context resolution. If your xaml views are named using the conventions listed above but your page or a view explicitly assigns the \nBindingContext\n property then MFractor will use the \nBindingContext\n return type instead of the implicit Mvvm relationship.\n\n\nData Template Binding Context Resolution\n\n\nData templates are used to provide a nested Xaml view to a view that displays many occurances of that view. For example, a ListView uses a \nDataTemplate\n to specify the view appearance of each instance provided through the \nItemsSource\n property.\n\n\nMFractor will attempt to infer the BindingContext for a data templates view by resolving the \nItemsSource\n property on the wrapping view.\n\n\nConsider the following code:\n\n\n  \nListView ItemsSource=\n{Binding Contacts}\n\n      \nListView.ItemTemplate\n\n        \nDataTemplate\n\n          \nTextCell Text=\n{Binding DisplayName}\n /\n\n        \n/DataTemplate\n\n      \n/ListView.ItemTemplate\n\n  \n/ListView\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inner \nDataTemplate\n has a \nTextCell\n where the \nText\n property is provided by the binding expression \n{Binding DisplayName}\n. To analyse this expression, MFractor requires a binding context; MFractor will walk out to the encapsulating view (ListView), locate the \nItemsSource\n property and evaluate the expression.\n\n\nWhen the return type is an \nIEnumerable\n or array, MFractor unwraps the generic or array and grabs the inner type. This provides the binding context type for the binding expressions used within the data template.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nIn summary, we've learnt that MFractor will use the binding context to power the Xaml analyser and navigation improvements.\n\n\n\n\nBinding expressions require a binding context to be analysed.\n\n\nWe can explicitly specify a binding context by assigning the \nBindingContext\n property of any Xaml element.\n\n\nWhen we name our code files using the Page.xaml, Page.xaml.cs and ViewModel convention, MFractor will assume an implicit MVVM relationship.\n\n\nData templates use the return type of the wrapping views \nItemSource\n property.",

            "text": "In Xamarin.Forms, all views have the property  BindingContext ; this specifies the object that a view should data-bind with. When coding with Xaml, we can use the  x:Static  markup extension to reference a static C# property and explicitly provide an instance of a C# class as the binding context:    Entry BindingContext= {x:Static local:MyStaticClass.MyStaticProperty} /   This is known as the  View Model Locator Pattern . We implement a static class named  ViewModelLocator  and use a static, readonly property to return an instance of the object we want our Xaml view to data-bind with. Historically the  View Model Locator Pattern  has been used to provide design time data to the Xamarin.Forms Xaml previewer. For a deeper insight into this pattern, read James Montemagnos excellent  View Model Locator  article.  For example, given a Xaml page named  LoginPage , we can explicitly provide an instance of  LoginViewModel  as the binding context like so:  ViewModelLocator.cs  public namespace MyApp\n{\n  public static class ViewModelLocator\n  {\n      public static readonly LoginViewModel LoginViewModel = new LoginViewModel();\n  }\n}  LoginPage.xaml  ContentPage\n  xmlns:local= clr-namespace:MyApp;assembly=MyApp \n  BindingContext= {x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel} /   When MFractor begins analysis on LoginPage.xaml it will check if any  BindingContext  properties have been assigned to. As the root  ContentPage  assigns a binding context, it will inspect the value component of the  BindingContext  attribute, check if it is a Xaml expression and then evaluate it for the return type.  For the  {x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel}  expression, MFractor will resolve the  ViewModelLocator  class in the  local  namespace and then grab the C# type of the  LoginViewModel  property. This informs MFractor that the page will be bound to a  LoginViewModel  instance and therefore to analyse all  Binding  expressions against the  LoginViewModel  type.  Explicit binding context resolution will also work when referencing another element using  x:Reference  expressions. For example, we can bind the on/off state of a switch to the visibility of a text label like so:     Switch x:Name= mySwitch  / \n   Label BindingContext= {x:Reference mySwitch}  IsVisible= {Binding IsToggled} /   When MFractor analyses the  {Binding IsToggled}  expression, it will evaluate the  {x:Reference mySwitch}  expression and use the type of mySwitch as the BindingContext (Xamarin.Forms.Switch).",

This is a Xamarin.Forms API that implements the \nIMarkupExtension interface\n; it reflects changes from the binding context to the view and vice-versa.\n\n\nWe use the binding markup extension syntax in our Xaml views:\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Username}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nLoginViewModel.cs\n\n\npublic class LoginViewModel\n{\n  public string Username { get; set; }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn the above example, \n{Binding Username}\n points to a public property on the \nLogingPage\ns binding context, the \nLoginViewModel\n.

This shortcut collects \nall\n missing binding expressions (excluding bindings inside DataTemplates) and generates them in bulk onto the binding context.\n\n\nWe can access this short cut by right clicking anywhere in a Xaml file, navigating to \nGenerate\n and then selecting the \nImplement View Model\n action:\n\n\n\n\nYou'll notice that there are 2 actions:\n\n\n\n\nImplement View Model\n gathers all missing bindings in the xaml document and implements them all as public properties with a public \nget\n and \nset\n accessor.\n\n\nImplement View Model (Use Backing Fields)\n gathers all missing bindings in the xaml document and implements them all as public properties with a public \nget\n and \nset\n accessor that sets or gets a backing field.\n\n\n\n\nThere are often cases when a binding context isn't specified \nexplicitly \n and can't be inferred \nimplicitly\n. A common example of this is that you have just started to build a Xaml view and haven't yet got around to building the corresponding view model.\n\n\nThe \nImplement View Model\n action can also generate a view model class for the Xaml view if one is not already defined. Using Mvvm naming conventions, MFractor generates a view model class for your xaml view under the \nMyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n namespace.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Username}\n/\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Password}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen creating the view model class, MFractor removes the \nPage\n or \nView\n suffix from the view name and then attaches \nViewModel\n to the end of the resulting name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove the \nPage\n or \nView\n suffix: LoginPage -\n Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttach the \nViewModel\n suffix: Login -\n LoginViewModel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a new class named \nLoginViewModel\n under the namespace \nMyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would result in the following view model class file:\n\n\nLoginViewModel.cs\n\n\npublic namespace MyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n{\n  public class LoginViewModel\n  {\n    public string Username { get; set; }\n    public string Password { get; set; }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you project references Fody's \nImplementPropertyChanged\n extension, the default getter / setter implementation will also annotate the result with the \n[ImplementPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged]\n attribute:\n\n\nLoginViewModel.cs\n\n\n[ImplementPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged]\npublic class LoginViewModel\n{\n}\n\n\n\n\nGenerating Commands Implementations\n\n\nWhen MFractor encounters a property that expects the \nSystem.Windows.Input.ICommand\n interface, it will generate a property returning a empty command implementation.\n\n\nFor example, we bind our login button to a \nLoginCommand\n property on our view model:\n\n\nButton Command=\n{Binding LoginCommand}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor generates the property for \nLoginCommand\n, it creates an empty command implementation:\n\n\npublic System.Windows.Input.ICommand LoginCommand\n{\n    get\n    {\n        return new Xamarin.Forms.Command(() =\n\n        {\n            throw new NotImplementedException();\n        }\n\n        );\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nBinding Generation And Value Converters\n\n\nWhen a binding expression uses a \nConverter\n, MFractor will attempt to resolve the input type of the referenced value converter and use that as the property type. We must have a value conversion attribute on the \nIValueConverter\n for MFractor to resolve the input type. Please read the \nValue Conversion Type-Safety\n tutorial to learn more.\n\n\nFor example, we add a login button that is only enabled when the user has their password entered:\n\n\nResourceDictionary\n\n    \nlocal:StringToBoolConverter x:Key=\nstringToBoolConverter\n /\n\n\n/ResourceDictionary\n\n\n\nButton IsEnabled=\n{Binding Password, Converter={StaticResource stringToBoolConverter}}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nProvided that \nstringToBoolConverter\n is annotated to accept string inputs and return a boolean output, MFractor can still generate \nPassword\n as a string even though \nIsEnabled\n is a boolean property.\n\n\nIf there is no value conversion information on the value converter, MFractor will default to \nSysten.Object\n as the type for our property:\n\n\npublic System.Object Password\n{\n  get; set;\n}\n\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\nThere are a some limitations in the \nImplement View Model\n refactoring:\n\n\n\n\nWhen a Xaml view has an item that uses a \nDataTemplate\n to declare an inline view, MFractor \nwill not\n gather the bindings inside the data template.

But what if we had a screen with an email entry that needs to change color when the user enters a valid email?\n\n\nEnter the \nIValueConverter interface\n; value converters transform one data type to another.\n\n\nWe can expose a boolean \nIsEmailValid\n on our binding context, bind the \nTextColor\n field of the entry to the \nIsEmailValid\n property and use an \nIValueConverter\n that converts a \nTrue\n value to black and a \nFalse\n value to red.\n\n\nOur converter would look like this:\n\n\npublic class BoolToTextColorConverter : IValueConverter\n{\n    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        return (bool)value ? Color.Black : Color.Red;\n    }\n\n    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAnd when used in our xaml:\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nUTF-8\n?\n\n\nContentPage\n        xmlns=\nhttp://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms\n\n        xmlns:x=\nhttp://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml\n\n        x:Class=\nMyApp.LoginPage\n\n        xmlns:converters=\nclr-namespace:MyApp.Converters;assembly=MyApp\n\n    \nContentPage.Resources\n\n        \nResourceDictionary\n\n            \nconverters:BoolToTextColorConverter x:Key=\nboolToTextColorConverter\n /\n\n        \n/ResourceDictionary\n\n    \n/ContentPage.Resources\n\n    \nEntry TextColor=\n{Binding IsEmailValid, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}}\n/\n\n\n/ContentPage\n\n\n\n\n\nNow when the user enters an invalid email, the value converter will translate the \nIsEmailValid\n boolean property in a \nXamarin.Forms.Color\n!\n\n\nBut what if we accidentally provided a \nstring\n to the \nBoolToTextColorConverter\n:\n\n\nEntry TextColor=\n{Binding Email, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nThis creates a runtime bug we won't discover until we build, deploy and navigate to the \nLoginPage\n; we'll see a type cast exception without a clear indication of the problem.\n\n\nWe can completely avoid this problem by declaring a value converters intent with an \nValueConversionAttribute\n to hint to MFractor's Xaml analyser it's expected behaviour.\n\n\nThe ValueConversion Attribute\n\n\nIn WPF, Microsoft provides the \nValueConversionAttribute\n that developers can use to describe the input, output and parameter type that an \nIValueConverter\n expects. This class level annotation declares the intent of a value converter to tools and to other developers using a converter.\n\n\nUnfortunately this attribute is in the \nPresentationFramework\n assembly, which we can't reference in a Xamarin.Forms PCL or shared project.\n\n\nAs the \nValueConversionAttribute\n is simple in implementation, we can easily make our own:\n\n\n[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class, AllowMultiple = true)]\npublic class ValueConversionAttribute : Attribute\n{\n  public ValueConversionAttribute(Type input, Type output)\n  {\n  }\n\n  public Type ParameterType { get; set; }\n}\n\n\n\n\nLet's examine this attribute in detail:\n\n\n\n\nThe constructor \nValueConversionAttribute(Type input, Type output)\n declares the expected input and output types for a converter.\n\n\nType input\n is the expected \ninput\n type for the value converter. This is the argument \nobject value\n for the \nConvert\n method and the return type for the \nConvertBack\n method.\n\n\nType output\n is the expected \noutput\n type for the value converter. This is the return type for the \nConvert\n method and the argument \nobject value\n for the \nConvertBack\n method.\n\n\nThe property \nType ParameterType\n is the expected \nparamter\n type for the value converter. This is the argument \nobject parameter\n for the \nConvert\n and \nConvertBack\n methods.\n\n\n\n\nTo use the \nValueConversionAttribute\n in our source code, we annotate a value converter at the class level and use the \ntypeof\n operator to provide input, output and parameter types:\n\n\n[ValueConversion(typeof(bool), typeof(Xamarin.Forms.Color))]\npublic class BoolToTextColorConverter : IValueConverter\n{\n    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        return (bool)value ? Color.Black : Color.Red;\n    }\n\n    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe \nBoolToTextColorConverter\n now declares it's intent when converting values to both tooling and other developers; it \nmust\n have a \nbool\n as an input and it \nmust\n return into a \nXamarin.Forms.Color\n type.\n\n\nTo include the \nValueConversionAttribute\n we can simply copy-paste the code into our code base. Alternatively, add a third party library like \nFormsCommunityToolkit.Converters\n that has the \nValueConversionAttribute\n defined.\n\n\nConverter Type-Safety in Xaml\n\n\nWhen an \nIValueConverter\n is annotated with the \nValueConversion\n attribute, we declare to MFractor that our value converter wishes to enforce \ntype safety\n.\n\n\nThis has a few benefits:\n\n\n\n\nMFractor can now verify the types passed into and returned by a \nConverter\n expression are correct in the given context.\n\n\nWhen MFractor is generating a property from a binding expression, it can now extract the type information for a converter and generate that property with the correct type information.\n\n\n\n\nLet's consider our previous example of a provided a string as the input to the \nBoolToTextColorConverter\n:\n\n\nEntry TextColor=\n{Binding Email, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen analysing the \nBinding\n expression, MFractor will inspect for \nConverter\n expressions and then evaluate the inner converter for it's expected input and output type.\n\n\nAs we have provided a \nstring\n but \nBoolToTextColorConverter\n expects a \nbool\n, MFractor will mark this as an error within the Xaml editor:\n\n\n\n\nVoila! We now have type-safety in our Xaml when using value converters! \u2728\u2728\n\n\nAnnotated value converters also allow the refactoring engine to correctly generate properties.\n\n\nFor example, if the our binding context is missing the \nEmail\n property, MFractor will extract the input type from the value converter and use that to generate the binding property:\n\n\n\n\nInstead of using the type of the \nTextColor\n property, MFractor could see that \nBoolToTextColorConverter\n expected a \nbool\n value and then generated the \nEmail\n property with a \nbool\n.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nIn this tutorial we learnt:\n\n\n\n\nWe can annotate implementations of \nIValueConverter\n with a \nValueConversionAttribute\n to declare it's value conversion intent.\n\n\nAnnotated value converters enable MFractor's Xaml analyser to provide type-safety in the Xaml editor.\n\n\nAnnotated value converters enable MFractor's refactoring engine to generate properties with the correct type information.",

            "text": "In WPF, Microsoft provides the  ValueConversionAttribute  that developers can use to describe the input, output and parameter type that an  IValueConverter  expects. This class level annotation declares the intent of a value converter to tools and to other developers using a converter.  Unfortunately this attribute is in the  PresentationFramework  assembly, which we can't reference in a Xamarin.Forms PCL or shared project.  As the  ValueConversionAttribute  is simple in implementation, we can easily make our own:  [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class, AllowMultiple = true)]\npublic class ValueConversionAttribute : Attribute\n{\n  public ValueConversionAttribute(Type input, Type output)\n  {\n  }\n\n  public Type ParameterType { get; set; }\n}  Let's examine this attribute in detail:   The constructor  ValueConversionAttribute(Type input, Type output)  declares the expected input and output types for a converter.  Type input  is the expected  input  type for the value converter. This is the argument  object value  for the  Convert  method and the return type for the  ConvertBack  method.  Type output  is the expected  output  type for the value converter. This is the return type for the  Convert  method and the argument  object value  for the  ConvertBack  method.  The property  Type ParameterType  is the expected  paramter  type for the value converter. This is the argument  object parameter  for the  Convert  and  ConvertBack  methods.   To use the  ValueConversionAttribute  in our source code, we annotate a value converter at the class level and use the  typeof  operator to provide input, output and parameter types:  [ValueConversion(typeof(bool), typeof(Xamarin.Forms.Color))]\npublic class BoolToTextColorConverter : IValueConverter\n{\n    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        return (bool)value ? Color.Black : Color.Red;\n    }\n\n    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}  The  BoolToTextColorConverter  now declares it's intent when converting values to both tooling and other developers; it  must  have a  bool  as an input and it  must  return into a  Xamarin.Forms.Color  type.  To include the  ValueConversionAttribute  we can simply copy-paste the code into our code base. Alternatively, add a third party library like  FormsCommunityToolkit.Converters  that has the  ValueConversionAttribute  defined.",

            "text": "When an  IValueConverter  is annotated with the  ValueConversion  attribute, we declare to MFractor that our value converter wishes to enforce  type safety .  This has a few benefits:   MFractor can now verify the types passed into and returned by a  Converter  expression are correct in the given context.  When MFractor is generating a property from a binding expression, it can now extract the type information for a converter and generate that property with the correct type information.   Let's consider our previous example of a provided a string as the input to the  BoolToTextColorConverter :  Entry TextColor= {Binding Email, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}} /   When analysing the  Binding  expression, MFractor will inspect for  Converter  expressions and then evaluate the inner converter for it's expected input and output type.  As we have provided a  string  but  BoolToTextColorConverter  expects a  bool , MFractor will mark this as an error within the Xaml editor:   Voila! We now have type-safety in our Xaml when using value converters! \u2728\u2728  Annotated value converters also allow the refactoring engine to correctly generate properties.  For example, if the our binding context is missing the  Email  property, MFractor will extract the input type from the value converter and use that to generate the binding property:   Instead of using the type of the  TextColor  property, MFractor could see that  BoolToTextColorConverter  expected a  bool  value and then generated the  Email  property with a  bool .",

\n/ContentPage.Resources\n\n\n/ContentPage\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above example, the declaration \nx:String\nHello World!\n/x:String\n is declared directly inside the property setter, which will cause a type-mismatch exception at runtime.\n\n\nWhen actioned, the \nEncapsulate with resource dictionary\n fix will wrap elements inside a resources property setter node with a resource dictionary. This would correct the above sample to:\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nutf-8\n?\n\n\nContentPage xmlns=\nhttp://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms\n\n    xmlns:x=\nhttp://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml\n\n    x:Class=\nHelloMFractor.HelloMFractorPage\n\n    \nContentPage.Resources\n\n    \nResourceDictionary\n\n          \nx:String\nHello World!\n/x:String\n\n    \n/ResourceDictionary\n\n    \n/ContentPage.Resources\n\n\n/ContentPage\n\n\n\n\n\nImport Value Converter For Binding\n\n\nConfiguration Id: com.mfractor.code_fixes.forms.import_resolving_value_converter\n\n\nInspects for IValueConverter implementations within the project and it's references that match the value conversion flow for this binding type mismatch.

TextColor=\"{Binding Color}\" : A property named  Color  of type  Xamarin.Forms.Color .  FontSize=\"{Binding Size}\" : A property named  Message  of type  double .   Then it generates the property declarations using those names and types, creates a new class named  LoginViewModel  and then writes a new file named  LoginViewModel.cs  containing the new class definition.  The generated code would be:  using System;\nnamespace MyApp.ViewModels\n{\n    public class LoginViewModel\n    {\n        public string Message { get; set; }\n        public Xamarin.Forms.Color Color { get; set; }\n        public double Size { get; set; }\n    }\n}",

For example, the \nLayoutOptions\n class has the static fields \nFill\n or \nCentreAndExpand\n that can be used a literal attribute values. If \nCentreAndFill\n was provided (an invalid value), this analyser would inspect the \nLayoutOptions\n class for a static field named \nCentreAndFill\n and trigger an analysis error when it couldn't be found.\n\n\nValidate Value Types\n\n\nInspects the input provided to attributes that expect value types (int, bool, double etc) and validates that the input is valid.\n\n\nXaml Node Resolves\n\n\nChecks that xaml nodes map to a valid .NET symbol.\n\n\nOnPlatform Return Type Mismatch\n\n\nChecks the type returned by a \nXamarin.Forms.OnPlatform\n element is valid with the parent property type.\n\n\nOnIdiom Return Type Mismatch\n\n\nChecks the type returned by a \nXamarin.Forms.OnIdiom\n element is valid with the parent property type.\n\n\nProperty Setter Node Misuse\n\n\nInspects for property setters that don't apply to the outer class.

For example if both \nxmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:MFractor.Licensing.MobileApp\"\n and \nxmlns:myassembly=\"clr-namespace:MFractor.Licensing.MobileApp\"\n were declared, this analyser would warn that they both reference the same assembly and namespace.\n\n\nCode Behind Class Type Mismatch\n\n\nInspects the type defined by the root Xaml node and compares it against the base type of the code behind class to check for a type-mismatch.\n\n\nRoot Element Defines Code Behind Class\n\n\nChecks that the root xaml node defines a code behind class using the \nx:Class\n directive\n\n\nUnused Resource\n\n\nInspects that resource dictionary entries are used via the \nStaticResource\n markup extension expression within this document.\n\n\nContentView Has Multiple Direct Children\n\n\nInspects usages of the \nContentView\n element and checks that it only has a single child view. Assigning multiple children into a \nContentView\n is a common mistake where the developer usually intended to wrap the chid views with a \nGrid\n or a \nStackLayout\n.\n\n\nContentPage Has Multiple Direct Children\n\n\nInspects usages of \nContentPage\n and checks that it only has a single child view. Assigning multiple children into a \nContentPage\n is a common mistake where the developer usually intended to wrap the chid views with a \nGrid\n or a \nStackLayout\n.\n\n\nInner Element Is Not Resource Dictionary\n\n\nInspects the inner element(s) of a \nMyView.ResourceDictionary\n property setter node  and checks that a resource dictionary is the inner element. It is common to forget to use a resource dictionary before adding resources\n\n\nReferenced Code Behind Field Exists\n\n\nInspects usages of the \nx:Reference\n expression and validates the referenced element has been declared within the document. \nx:Reference\n expressions are used to resolve another Xaml node has a code behind field defined using the \nx:Name\n attribute.",

Initially we are limiting the amount of options that are exposed but over time we will drastically increase the flexibility of MFractors code generation engine.\n\n\nHow does it work?

You can now tap Alt+Return in Xaml documents to quickly access any fixes or refactorings at that location, the xaml analyser has been tuned for speed and a new code issue tooltip gives deeper insight into the code issue beneath it:\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nThe quick fix menu is now available to quickly access all Xaml actions. Tap Alt+Return in your Xaml document for a list of available code actions to appear!\n\n\nThe xaml analyser integration has been rebuilt and as such, xaml analysis is now much, much quicker. You might notice that fixable issues no longer underline in yellow; the check for available fixes is now.\n\n\nAn improved code issue tooltip now appears when you hover over a xaml or android resource. This tooltip tells you what kind of error it is (Compile time, runtime or code improvement), presents information on the issue and let's you know if any fixes are available.\n\n\n\n\nEnhancements\n\n\n\n\nImprove the can execute checking algorithms for all code actions (refactorings, issue fixes etc) to reduce the noise in the quick fix menu.\n\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n\n\n\n\nFixed: When generating a view model and the view has bindings against an unknown class, previously these bindings would be missed.\n\n\n\n\n##Release Notes - v2.9.4\n\n\n22nd February 2017\n\n\nDownload MFractor 2.9.4\n\n\n##Introduction\n\n\nThis is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.9.4 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.\n\n\nImportant: If Visual Studio Mac loses IntelliSense/Code Completion when you update to cycle 9 (XS v6.2), uninstall MFractor and upgrade to the latest version\n\n\nThis release focuses on keeping your Xaml tidy... you can now rename xaml namespaces, align the naming of duplicate namespace imports and format your entire Xaml document.\n\n\nIt's also easier than ever to build out custom controls, the new \nImplement Missing Members\n code generator can bulk implement properties or bindable properties onto custom views in your Xaml. No need to hand code bindable properties!\n\n\nHold onto your socks!\n\n\n\n\n##Features\n\n\n- **New Refactorings**\n - Right click on an `xmlns` declaration on the root node and select **Refactor** -\n **Rename Xaml Namespace** to rename all occurrences of that namespace in the doc!\n- **New Code Organisers**\n - Right click on the root xaml node and select **Organise** -\n **Format** to organise your entire xaml document.\n- **New Code Generators**\n - Quickly build out Grids by using the **Insert Row Definitions** and **Insert Column Definitions** actions.\n - Bulk implement missing properties on a class by right clicking on the xaml node with the missing members and selecting **Implement missing members**.\n- **New Xaml Analysers**\n - Detect if the root xaml element uses a `x:Name` attribute as this is redundant.\n - Detect duplicate xaml namespaces that reference the same namespace and assembly.\n - Detect when the xaml views code behind class derives from a different type than what is declared by it's root element.\n- **New Code Fixes**\n - When a xaml namespace references the same namespace and assembly, you can now rename all duplicate namespace declarations to a certain namespace to align the usages in your xaml.\n\n\n\n##Enhancements\n\n\n\n\nFreshMVVM style page models (EG: LoginPageModel) are now supported for view \n-\n view model \n-\n code behind association.\n\n\nThe \nModel\n suffix (EG: LoginModel) is now supported for view \n-\n view model \n-\n code behind association.\n\n\nThis release targets Visual Studio Mac v6.2.\n\n\n\n\n##Bug Fixes\n\n\n\n\nUndefined StaticResource detection has been disabled in this release.\n\n\nFixed: When generating view models, if a binding expression was within an undefined control property, the refactoring would fail as it could not resolve the member type. Undefined properties will now auto-generate using \nSystem.Object\n.\n\n\nFixed: When generating a static property from an x:Static expression whose outer attribute is unresolved, now default to use \nSystem.Object\n.\n\n\nFixed: When generating members or static properties onto a code behind class, sometimes the insertion point would jump to the xaml.g.cs auto-generated class.\n\n\nFixed: When the Visual Studio Mac Xamarin Forms Previewer is open, the refactoring engine would fail to commit text replace changes.\n\n\n\n\n##Release Notes - v2.8.0\n\n\n12th February 2017\n\n\nDownload MFractor 2.8.0\n\n\n##Introduction\n\n\nThis is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.8.0 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.\n\n\nThis release focuses on adding new refactoring and code generation actions into the Xaml editor.\n\n\nYou can now sort your xaml, edit colors interactively, extract values into binding expressions and more:\n\n\n\n\n##Features\n\n\n - **New Refactorings**\n  - Right click on a xaml attribute property that's a `System.Drawing.Color` or a `Xamarin.Forms.Color` and edit it using the color selection dialog. This action won't be available if the attribute value is an expression.\n  - Right click on a xaml attribute property that has a literal value and extract it into a `Binding` expression. This action is not available if the attribute value is an expression or the attribute does not have a corresponding bindable property.\n  - **Organise Refactorings:**\n      - The *Collapse Xaml Attributes* refactoring will collapse all xaml attributes onto the same line as the parent xaml node.\n      - The *Expand Xaml Attributes* refactoring will expand all xaml attributes onto separate lines.\n      - The *Sort Xaml Attributes* refactoring will sort the attributes for a xaml node by namespace and name.\n      - The *Expand Node* refactoring takes a self-closing xaml node and generate a closing tag for it.\n      - The *Collapse Node* refactoring takes a xaml node with no children and a closing tag and removes the closing tag to make the node self-closing.\n - **New Code Generators**\n  - Right click on an xaml node that inherits from `Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement` or `Xamarin.Forms.Application` and select **Add Resource Dictionary** to generate a resource dictionary for that element.\n - **New Xaml Analysers**\n  - Detect when an `x:Name` code-behind field declaration is empty.\n\n\n\n##Enhancements\n\n\n\n\nThis release targets Visual Studio Mac v6.1.5\n\n\nThe \nImplement View Model\n refactoring has been moved from the \nRefactor\n menu to \nGenerate\n.\n\n\nHover over a xaml attribute property that's a \nSystem.Drawing.Color\n or a \nXamarin.Forms.Color\n to see the color value inside the tooltip.\n\n\nThe Android SDK meta-data has been removed from MFractor.mpack; you can download and update the sdk meta-data through the \nHelp\n -\n \nMFractor\n -\n \nInstall Android SDK Meta-Data\n menu item.\n\n\n\n\n##Bug Fixes\n\n\n\n\nCorrectly validate the type provided to x:TypeArguments; there was a bug in the type checking algorithm.\n\n\nDon't allow the 'Simplify' refactoring to run against expressions.\n\n\nFix multiple type conversion checking bugs in the ValueConversion attribute validation.\n\n\n\n\n##Release Notes - v2.7.0\n\n\n8th January 2017\n\n\nDownload MFractor 2.7.0\n\n\n##Introduction\n\n\nThis is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.7.0 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.\n\n\nThis release adds the ability implement entire view models, introduces a dozen xaml analysers and fixes many bugs.\n\n\nI recommend taking a moment to read these tutorials:\n\n\n* [Implementing View Models](/xamarin-forms/implementing-view-models.md): Learn implement entire view models using the **Implement View Model** refactoring.\n* [Value Converter Type Safety](/xamarin-forms/value-converter-type-safety.md): Learn to annotate `IValueConverter`s with value conversion attributes for `Converter` expression type-safety.\n\n\n\n##Introducing View Model Generation\n\n\nYou already love being able to generate bindings but I've taken it to the next level this release \ud83d\udcaa\n\n\n\n\nGot a heap of unimplemented bindings? Right click anywhere in your Xaml document and select \nRefactor\n -\n \nImplement View Model\n.\n\n\nMFractor will collect all the missing bindings and then generate a new class with \nall\n of those properties into a namespace named \nMyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n.\n\n\nDoes the view model already exist? Then MFractor simply inserts the missing bindings into the existing view model.\n\n\nI think it'll save you enough time during the week that you may just get to Friday beers a few hours early \ud83c\udf7b\n\n\n##Features\n\n\n- By right clicking anywhere in a Xaml document, implement all missing bindings as a new or into an existing view model:\n    - Implement view model properties with a getter and setter.\n    - Implement view model properties with a backing field.\n    - Bound properties that return `ICommand` will have an empty `Xamarin.Forms.Command` instance generated.\n    - When MFractor encounters binding expressions that use a `Converter`, it inspects the converter for a `ValueConversion` attribute to deduce the input typed required. If it can't resolve the converter or the converter does not have value conversion information, it will default to using `System.Object`.\n    - When implementing a new view model with getter and setters, MFractor will inspect for references to Fody's `ImplementPropertyChanged` and annotate the new class with it.\n- **New Xaml Analysers:**\n    - Validate that elements declared inside a resource dictionary have an x:Key.\n    - Validate that elements declared inside a resource dictionary have a unique x:Key value.\n    - Detect when an x:TypeArguments is used on a non-generic type and warn of incorrect usage.\n    - Detect when a property setter node (`\nMyClass.MyProperty/\n`) references a non-existent member on the parent class.\n    - Detect when a property setter attribute is empty.\n    - Detect when an undefined static resource is referenced by a `StaticResource` expression.\n    - Detect when the value returned by a `StaticResource` expression causes a type mismatch.\n    - Detect when an unknown type is being provided to a `x:TypeArguments` attribute.\n    - Validate that `OnIdiom` elements return the correct type for the outer property setter.\n    - Validate that `OnPlatform` elements return the correct type for the outer property setter.\n    - Detect when a developer has misused a property setter inside another xaml element. For example, `OnIdiom.Phone` doesn't make any sense when wrapped by the outer element `OnPlatform`.\n    - Detect when an incorrect input type is provided to a `Converter`. The value converter must have a `ValueConversion` attribute for this to trigger.\n    - Detect when an incorrect output type is returned by a `Converter` expression. The value converter must have a `ValueConversion` attribute for this to trigger.\n    - Detect when multiple occurrences of the same automation ID exists within a Xaml document.\n- **New Xaml Fixes:**\n    - Generate missing resource dictionary keys.\n    - Auto-correct misspelt `StaticResource` references.\n- **New Simplify Refactorings:**\n    - Attributes that use a static instance to initialize the property (eg `VerticalOptions=\"LayoutOptions.CentreAndExpand\"`) can now be simplified to just the instance name (eg `VerticalOptions=\"CentreAndExpand\"`).\n\n\n\n##Enhancements\n\n\n- This release targets Visual Studio Mac v6.1.3\n- The **About MFractor** dialog now contains a button to copy version and IDE information into the clipboard for bug reports. See [Support - Filing A Bug Report](/faq.md#how-do-i-file-a-bug-report) for more information on filing a bug report.\n- This release introduces the framework for an Xml and Xaml refactoring engine. Over time, I'll be adding Xml and Xaml refactoring operations to make code cleanup a breeze.\n- Annotating value converters with a `ValueConversion(typeof(InputType), typeof(OutputType))` attribute will trigger the conversion information to render into tooltip. See [FormsCommunityToolkit.Converters](https://github.com/FormsCommunityToolkit/Converters) for examples.\n\n\n\n##Bug Fixes\n\n\n- Sometimes the Xaml document analyser would fail to load and bring down the Xaml editor. This has been fixed.\n- The View \n - \n Code Behind navigation shortcuts would break when an AST parse was in progress. View \n - \n Code Behind shortcuts will now always be active.\n- When property setter nodes are used (`\nMyClass.MyProperty/\n`), the class component is now correctly validated.\n- When importing a Xaml namespace, the element is inserted on a newline and formatted to align with other attributes.\n- When resolving the binding context for nested DataTemplates, sometimes the binding context resolver would fail on generics or IEnumerables\n- More resilient Mvvm resolver to drive the 'Go To View Model', 'Go To Xaml View' and 'Go To Code Behind' shortcuts. MFractor will attempt to infer as best possible the associations between those 3 files.\n- Save the project after adding a new file to it.\n\n\n##Release Notes - v2.6.0\n\n**31st October 2016**\n\n**[Download MFractor 2.6.0](http://addins.mfractor.com/releases/2.06.00/MFractor.MFractor_2.06.00.mpack)**\n\n##Introduction\n\nThis is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.6.0 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.\n\nAs a major release, this release adds several code generation capabilities to improve your Xaml workflow.

Important: If Visual Studio Mac loses IntelliSense/Code Completion when you update to cycle 9 (XS v6.2), uninstall MFractor and upgrade to the latest version  This release focuses on keeping your Xaml tidy... you can now rename xaml namespaces, align the naming of duplicate namespace imports and format your entire Xaml document.  It's also easier than ever to build out custom controls, the new  Implement Missing Members  code generator can bulk implement properties or bindable properties onto custom views in your Xaml. No need to hand code bindable properties!  Hold onto your socks!   ##Features  - **New Refactorings**\n - Right click on an `xmlns` declaration on the root node and select **Refactor** -  **Rename Xaml Namespace** to rename all occurrences of that namespace in the doc!\n- **New Code Organisers**\n - Right click on the root xaml node and select **Organise** -  **Format** to organise your entire xaml document.\n- **New Code Generators**\n - Quickly build out Grids by using the **Insert Row Definitions** and **Insert Column Definitions** actions.\n - Bulk implement missing properties on a class by right clicking on the xaml node with the missing members and selecting **Implement missing members**.\n- **New Xaml Analysers**\n - Detect if the root xaml element uses a `x:Name` attribute as this is redundant.\n - Detect duplicate xaml namespaces that reference the same namespace and assembly.\n - Detect when the xaml views code behind class derives from a different type than what is declared by it's root element.\n- **New Code Fixes**\n - When a xaml namespace references the same namespace and assembly, you can now rename all duplicate namespace declarations to a certain namespace to align the usages in your xaml.  ##Enhancements   FreshMVVM style page models (EG: LoginPageModel) are now supported for view  -  view model  -  code behind association.  The  Model  suffix (EG: LoginModel) is now supported for view  -  view model  -  code behind association.  This release targets Visual Studio Mac v6.2.   ##Bug Fixes   Undefined StaticResource detection has been disabled in this release.  Fixed: When generating view models, if a binding expression was within an undefined control property, the refactoring would fail as it could not resolve the member type. Undefined properties will now auto-generate using  System.Object .  Fixed: When generating a static property from an x:Static expression whose outer attribute is unresolved, now default to use  System.Object .  Fixed: When generating members or static properties onto a code behind class, sometimes the insertion point would jump to the xaml.g.cs auto-generated class.  Fixed: When the Visual Studio Mac Xamarin Forms Previewer is open, the refactoring engine would fail to commit text replace changes.   ##Release Notes - v2.8.0  12th February 2017  Download MFractor 2.8.0  ##Introduction  This is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.8.0 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.  This release focuses on adding new refactoring and code generation actions into the Xaml editor.  You can now sort your xaml, edit colors interactively, extract values into binding expressions and more:   ##Features   - **New Refactorings**\n  - Right click on a xaml attribute property that's a `System.Drawing.Color` or a `Xamarin.Forms.Color` and edit it using the color selection dialog. This action won't be available if the attribute value is an expression.\n  - Right click on a xaml attribute property that has a literal value and extract it into a `Binding` expression. This action is not available if the attribute value is an expression or the attribute does not have a corresponding bindable property.\n  - **Organise Refactorings:**\n      - The *Collapse Xaml Attributes* refactoring will collapse all xaml attributes onto the same line as the parent xaml node.\n      - The *Expand Xaml Attributes* refactoring will expand all xaml attributes onto separate lines.\n      - The *Sort Xaml Attributes* refactoring will sort the attributes for a xaml node by namespace and name.\n      - The *Expand Node* refactoring takes a self-closing xaml node and generate a closing tag for it.\n      - The *Collapse Node* refactoring takes a xaml node with no children and a closing tag and removes the closing tag to make the node self-closing.\n - **New Code Generators**\n  - Right click on an xaml node that inherits from `Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement` or `Xamarin.Forms.Application` and select **Add Resource Dictionary** to generate a resource dictionary for that element.\n - **New Xaml Analysers**\n  - Detect when an `x:Name` code-behind field declaration is empty.  ##Enhancements   This release targets Visual Studio Mac v6.1.5  The  Implement View Model  refactoring has been moved from the  Refactor  menu to  Generate .  Hover over a xaml attribute property that's a  System.Drawing.Color  or a  Xamarin.Forms.Color  to see the color value inside the tooltip.  The Android SDK meta-data has been removed from MFractor.mpack; you can download and update the sdk meta-data through the  Help  -   MFractor  -   Install Android SDK Meta-Data  menu item.   ##Bug Fixes   Correctly validate the type provided to x:TypeArguments; there was a bug in the type checking algorithm.  Don't allow the 'Simplify' refactoring to run against expressions.  Fix multiple type conversion checking bugs in the ValueConversion attribute validation.   ##Release Notes - v2.7.0  8th January 2017  Download MFractor 2.7.0  ##Introduction  This is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.7.0 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.

Then MFractor simply inserts the missing bindings into the existing view model.  I think it'll save you enough time during the week that you may just get to Friday beers a few hours early \ud83c\udf7b  ##Features  - By right clicking anywhere in a Xaml document, implement all missing bindings as a new or into an existing view model:\n    - Implement view model properties with a getter and setter.\n    - Implement view model properties with a backing field.\n    - Bound properties that return `ICommand` will have an empty `Xamarin.Forms.Command` instance generated.\n    - When MFractor encounters binding expressions that use a `Converter`, it inspects the converter for a `ValueConversion` attribute to deduce the input typed required.
