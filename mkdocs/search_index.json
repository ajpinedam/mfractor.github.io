This is accomplished through \ndata binding\n; properties on a view are bound to properties on a backing object through binding mechanisms allowing two-way data transfer between the UI and application logic. For a full tutorial on Mvvm architecture, please Microsofts \nThe Mvvm Pattern\n article.\n\n\nWhen working with Xaml, we can specify a binding context to activate binding expression analysis and a variety of BindingContext specific refactorings.\n\n\nWe can specify a binding context \nexplicitly\n via in inline Xaml expression or \nimplicitly\n through the use of common MVVM naming conventions.\n\n\nImplicit Binding Context Resolution\n\n\nMFractor will attempt to infer the relationship between your view models and xaml views via \nimplicit binding context resolution\n. This is done by looking for classes and Xaml views that share a common naming convention.\n\n\nLet's consider the following files:\n\n\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml\n - The xaml view.\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n - The code behind for the xaml view.\n\n\nLoginViewModel\n - The a C# class that is the view model for the LoginPage view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause these pages share the prefix \nLogin\n and each has a distinct file extension or suffix, MFractor assumes the following relationships:\n\n\n\n\nThe \n.xaml\n extension denotes that \nLoginPage.xaml\n is a xaml view.\n\n\nThe \n.xaml.cs\n extension and the \nLoginPage\n component denotes that \nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n is the code behind implementation \nLoginPage\n view.\n\n\nThe \nViewModel\n suffix implies that \nLoginViewModel\n is a view model. When \nViewModel\n is removed from \nLoginViewModel\n and \nPage\n is removed from \nLoginPage\n, the \nLogin\n component implies that the \nLoginViewModel\n is related to the \nLoginPage\n xaml view and it's code behind file.\n\n\n\n\nMFractor uses these common naming conventions of Page.xaml, Page.xaml.cs and ViewModel to decide that \nLoginViewModel\n will probably be the BindingContext for \nLoginPage\n. The \nPage\n \n-\n \nViewModel\n naming convention is used by several popular MVVM frameworks such as Prism and FreshMVVM.\n\n\nThe following suffixes are supported for Xaml views:\n\n\n\n\nPage\n: EG LoginPage.xaml \n-\n LoginViewModel\n\n\nView\n: EG LoginView.xaml \n-\n LoginViewModel\n\n\n\n\nExplicit Binding Context Resolution\n\n\nIn Xamarin.Forms, all views have the property \nBindingContext\n; this specifies the object that a view should data-bind with. When coding with Xaml, we can use the \nx:Static\n markup extension to reference a static C# property and explicitly provide an instance of a C# class as the binding context:\n\n\n \nEntry BindingContext=\n{x:Static local:MyStaticClass.MyStaticProperty}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is known as the \nView Model Locator Pattern\n. We implement a static class named \nViewModelLocator\n and use a static, readonly property to return an instance of the object we want our Xaml view to data-bind with. Historically the \nView Model Locator Pattern\n has been used to provide design time data to the Xamarin.Forms Xaml previewer. For a deeper insight into this pattern, read James Montemagnos excellent \nView Model Locator\n article.\n\n\nFor example, given a Xaml page named \nLoginPage\n, we can explicitly provide an instance of \nLoginViewModel\n as the binding context like so:\n\n\nViewModelLocator.cs\n\n\npublic namespace MyApp\n{\n  public static class ViewModelLocator\n  {\n      public static readonly LoginViewModel LoginViewModel = new LoginViewModel();\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml\n\n\nContentPage\n  xmlns:local=\nclr-namespace:MyApp;assembly=MyApp\n\n  BindingContext=\n{x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor begins analysis on LoginPage.xaml it will check if any \nBindingContext\n properties have been assigned to. As the root \nContentPage\n assigns a binding context, it will inspect the value component of the \nBindingContext\n attribute, check if it is a Xaml expression and then evaluate it for the return type.\n\n\nFor the \n{x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel}\n expression, MFractor will resolve the \nViewModelLocator\n class in the \nlocal\n namespace and then grab the C# type of the \nLoginViewModel\n property. This informs MFractor that the page will be bound to a \nLoginViewModel\n instance and therefore to analyse all \nBinding\n expressions against the \nLoginViewModel\n type.\n\n\nExplicit binding context resolution will also work when referencing another element using \nx:Reference\n expressions. For example, we can bind the on/off state of a switch to the visibility of a text label like so:\n\n\n  \nSwitch x:Name=\nmySwitch\n /\n\n  \nLabel BindingContext=\n{x:Reference mySwitch}\n IsVisible=\n{Binding IsToggled}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor analyses the \n{Binding IsToggled}\n expression, it will evaluate the \n{x:Reference mySwitch}\n expression and use the type of mySwitch as the BindingContext (Xamarin.Forms.Switch).\n\n\nExplicit binding context resolution will \nalways\n override implicit binding context resolution. If your xaml views are named using the conventions listed above but your page or a view explicitly assigns the \nBindingContext\n property then MFractor will use the \nBindingContext\n return type instead of the implicit Mvvm relationship.\n\n\nData Template Binding Context Resolution\n\n\nData templates are used to provide a nested Xaml view to a view that displays many occurances of that view. For example, a ListView uses a \nDataTemplate\n to specify the view appearance of each instance provided through the \nItemsSource\n property.\n\n\nMFractor will attempt to infer the BindingContext for a data templates view by resolving the \nItemsSource\n property on the wrapping view.\n\n\nConsider the following code:\n\n\n  \nListView ItemsSource=\n{Binding Contacts}\n\n      \nListView.ItemTemplate\n\n        \nDataTemplate\n\n          \nTextCell Text=\n{Binding DisplayName}\n /\n\n        \n/DataTemplate\n\n      \n/ListView.ItemTemplate\n\n  \n/ListView\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inner \nDataTemplate\n has a \nTextCell\n where the \nText\n property is provided by the binding expression \n{Binding DisplayName}\n. To analyse this expression, MFractor requires a binding context; MFractor will walk out to the encapsulating view (ListView), locate the \nItemsSource\n property and evaluate the expression.\n\n\nWhen the return type is an \nIEnumerable\n or array, MFractor unwraps the generic or array and grabs the inner type. This provides the binding context type for the binding expressions used within the data template.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nIn summary, we've learnt that MFractor will use the binding context to power the Xaml analyser and navigation improvements.\n\n\n\n\nBinding expressions require a binding context to be analysed.\n\n\nWe can explicitly specify a binding context by assigning the \nBindingContext\n property of any Xaml element.\n\n\nWhen we name our code files using the Page.xaml, Page.xaml.cs and ViewModel convention, MFractor will assume an implicit MVVM relationship.\n\n\nData templates use the return type of the wrapping views \nItemSource\n property.",

This is done by looking for classes and Xaml views that share a common naming convention.  Let's consider the following files:   LoginPage.xaml  - The xaml view.  LoginPage.xaml.cs  - The code behind for the xaml view.  LoginViewModel  - The a C# class that is the view model for the LoginPage view.    Because these pages share the prefix  Login  and each has a distinct file extension or suffix, MFractor assumes the following relationships:   The  .xaml  extension denotes that  LoginPage.xaml  is a xaml view.  The  .xaml.cs  extension and the  LoginPage  component denotes that  LoginPage.xaml.cs  is the code behind implementation  LoginPage  view.  The  ViewModel  suffix implies that  LoginViewModel  is a view model. When  ViewModel  is removed from  LoginViewModel  and  Page  is removed from  LoginPage , the  Login  component implies that the  LoginViewModel  is related to the  LoginPage  xaml view and it's code behind file.   MFractor uses these common naming conventions of Page.xaml, Page.xaml.cs and ViewModel to decide that  LoginViewModel  will probably be the BindingContext for  LoginPage . The  Page   -   ViewModel  naming convention is used by several popular MVVM frameworks such as Prism and FreshMVVM.  The following suffixes are supported for Xaml views:   Page : EG LoginPage.xaml  -  LoginViewModel  View : EG LoginView.xaml  -  LoginViewModel",

            "text": "In Xamarin.Forms, all views have the property  BindingContext ; this specifies the object that a view should data-bind with. When coding with Xaml, we can use the  x:Static  markup extension to reference a static C# property and explicitly provide an instance of a C# class as the binding context:    Entry BindingContext= {x:Static local:MyStaticClass.MyStaticProperty} /   This is known as the  View Model Locator Pattern . We implement a static class named  ViewModelLocator  and use a static, readonly property to return an instance of the object we want our Xaml view to data-bind with. Historically the  View Model Locator Pattern  has been used to provide design time data to the Xamarin.Forms Xaml previewer. For a deeper insight into this pattern, read James Montemagnos excellent  View Model Locator  article.  For example, given a Xaml page named  LoginPage , we can explicitly provide an instance of  LoginViewModel  as the binding context like so:  ViewModelLocator.cs  public namespace MyApp\n{\n  public static class ViewModelLocator\n  {\n      public static readonly LoginViewModel LoginViewModel = new LoginViewModel();\n  }\n}  LoginPage.xaml  ContentPage\n  xmlns:local= clr-namespace:MyApp;assembly=MyApp \n  BindingContext= {x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel} /   When MFractor begins analysis on LoginPage.xaml it will check if any  BindingContext  properties have been assigned to. As the root  ContentPage  assigns a binding context, it will inspect the value component of the  BindingContext  attribute, check if it is a Xaml expression and then evaluate it for the return type.  For the  {x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel}  expression, MFractor will resolve the  ViewModelLocator  class in the  local  namespace and then grab the C# type of the  LoginViewModel  property. This informs MFractor that the page will be bound to a  LoginViewModel  instance and therefore to analyse all  Binding  expressions against the  LoginViewModel  type.  Explicit binding context resolution will also work when referencing another element using  x:Reference  expressions. For example, we can bind the on/off state of a switch to the visibility of a text label like so:     Switch x:Name= mySwitch  / \n   Label BindingContext= {x:Reference mySwitch}  IsVisible= {Binding IsToggled} /   When MFractor analyses the  {Binding IsToggled}  expression, it will evaluate the  {x:Reference mySwitch}  expression and use the type of mySwitch as the BindingContext (Xamarin.Forms.Switch).  Explicit binding context resolution will  always  override implicit binding context resolution.

This shortcut collects \nall\n missing binding expressions (excluding bindings inside DataTemplates) and generates them in bulk onto the binding context.\n\n\nWe can access this short cut by right clicking anywhere in a Xaml file, navigating to \nGenerate\n and then selecting the \nImplement View Model\n action:\n\n\n\n\nYou'll notice that there are 2 actions:\n\n\n\n\nImplement View Model\n gathers all missing bindings in the xaml document and implements them all as public properties with a public \nget\n and \nset\n accessor.\n\n\nImplement View Model (Use Backing Fields)\n gathers all missing bindings in the xaml document and implements them all as public properties with a public \nget\n and \nset\n accessor that sets or gets a backing field.\n\n\n\n\nThere are often cases when a binding context isn't specified \nexplicitly \n and can't be inferred \nimplicitly\n. A common example of this is that you have just started to build a Xaml view and haven't yet got around to building the corresponding view model.\n\n\nThe \nImplement View Model\n action can also generate a view model class for the Xaml view if one is not already defined. Using Mvvm naming conventions, MFractor generates a view model class for your xaml view under the \nMyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n namespace.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Username}\n/\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Password}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen creating the view model class, MFractor removes the \nPage\n or \nView\n suffix from the view name and then attaches \nViewModel\n to the end of the resulting name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove the \nPage\n or \nView\n suffix: LoginPage -\n Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttach the \nViewModel\n suffix: Login -\n LoginViewModel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a new class named \nLoginViewModel\n under the namespace \nMyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would result in the following view model class file:\n\n\nLoginViewModel.cs\n\n\npublic namespace MyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n{\n  public class LoginViewModel\n  {\n    public string Username { get; set; }\n    public string Password { get; set; }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you project references Fody's \nImplementPropertyChanged\n extension, the default getter / setter implementation will also annotate the result with the \n[ImplementPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged]\n attribute:\n\n\nLoginViewModel.cs\n\n\n[ImplementPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged]\npublic class LoginViewModel\n{\n}\n\n\n\n\nGenerating Commands Implementations\n\n\nWhen MFractor encounters a property that expects the \nSystem.Windows.Input.ICommand\n interface, it will generate a property returning a empty command implementation.\n\n\nFor example, we bind our login button to a \nLoginCommand\n property on our view model:\n\n\nButton Command=\n{Binding LoginCommand}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor generates the property for \nLoginCommand\n, it creates an empty command implementation:\n\n\npublic System.Windows.Input.ICommand LoginCommand\n{\n    get\n    {\n        return new Xamarin.Forms.Command(() =\n\n        {\n            throw new NotImplementedException();\n        }\n\n        );\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nBinding Generation And Value Converters\n\n\nWhen a binding expression uses a \nConverter\n, MFractor will attempt to resolve the input type of the referenced value converter and use that as the property type. We must have a value conversion attribute on the \nIValueConverter\n for MFractor to resolve the input type. Please read the \nValue Conversion Type-Safety\n tutorial to learn more.\n\n\nFor example, we add a login button that is only enabled when the user has their password entered:\n\n\nResourceDictionary\n\n    \nlocal:StringToBoolConverter x:Key=\nstringToBoolConverter\n /\n\n\n/ResourceDictionary\n\n\n\nButton IsEnabled=\n{Binding Password, Converter={StaticResource stringToBoolConverter}}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nProvided that \nstringToBoolConverter\n is annotated to accept string inputs and return a boolean output, MFractor can still generate \nPassword\n as a string even though \nIsEnabled\n is a boolean property.\n\n\nIf there is no value conversion information on the value converter, MFractor will default to \nSysten.Object\n as the type for our property:\n\n\npublic System.Object Password\n{\n  get; set;\n}\n\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\nThere are a some limitations in the \nImplement View Model\n refactoring:\n\n\n\n\nWhen a Xaml view has an item that uses a \nDataTemplate\n to declare an inline view, MFractor \nwill not\n gather the bindings inside the data template. A refactoring action to generate bindings for data templates will be coming in a future MFractor release.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nBy building our apps using the \nXaml first\n mindset, we can leverage MFractor's binding generation to implement our view models quickly.\n\n\nIn this tutorial we learnt:\n\n\n\n\nWe can generate entire view models using the \nImplement View Model\n refactoring action.\n\n\nWe can generate single properties using code issue fixing.\n\n\nWe need a binding context to activate binding expression analysis and issue fixing.\n\n\nWhen a binding uses a value converter, MFractor use the correct type when the converter has a value conversion attribute.",

But what if we had a screen with an email entry that needs to change color when the user enters a valid email?\n\n\nEnter the \nIValueConverter interface\n; value converters transform one data type to another.\n\n\nWe can expose a boolean \nIsEmailValid\n on our binding context, bind the \nTextColor\n field of the entry to the \nIsEmailValid\n property and use an \nIValueConverter\n that converts a \nTrue\n value to black and a \nFalse\n value to red.\n\n\nOur converter would look like this:\n\n\npublic class BoolToTextColorConverter : IValueConverter\n{\n    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        return (bool)value ? Color.Black : Color.Red;\n    }\n\n    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAnd when used in our xaml:\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nUTF-8\n?\n\n\nContentPage\n        xmlns=\nhttp://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms\n\n        xmlns:x=\nhttp://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml\n\n        x:Class=\nMyApp.LoginPage\n\n        xmlns:converters=\nclr-namespace:MyApp.Converters;assembly=MyApp\n\n    \nContentPage.Resources\n\n        \nResourceDictionary\n\n            \nconverters:BoolToTextColorConverter x:Key=\nboolToTextColorConverter\n /\n\n        \n/ResourceDictionary\n\n    \n/ContentPage.Resources\n\n    \nEntry TextColor=\n{Binding IsEmailValid, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}}\n/\n\n\n/ContentPage\n\n\n\n\n\nNow when the user enters an invalid email, the value converter will translate the \nIsEmailValid\n boolean property in a \nXamarin.Forms.Color\n!\n\n\nBut what if we accidentally provided a \nstring\n to the \nBoolToTextColorConverter\n:\n\n\nEntry TextColor=\n{Binding Email, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nThis creates a runtime bug we won't discover until we build, deploy and navigate to the \nLoginPage\n; we'll see a type cast exception without a clear indication of the problem.\n\n\nWe can completely avoid this problem by declaring a value converters intent with an \nValueConversionAttribute\n to hint to MFractor's Xaml analyser it's expected behaviour.\n\n\nThe ValueConversion Attribute\n\n\nIn WPF, Microsoft provides the \nValueConversionAttribute\n that developers can use to describe the input, output and parameter type that an \nIValueConverter\n expects. This class level annotation declares the intent of a value converter to tools and to other developers using a converter.\n\n\nUnfortunately this attribute is in the \nPresentationFramework\n assembly, which we can't reference in a Xamarin.Forms PCL or shared project.\n\n\nAs the \nValueConversionAttribute\n is simple in implementation, we can easily make our own:\n\n\n[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class, AllowMultiple = true)]\npublic class ValueConversionAttribute : Attribute\n{\n  public ValueConversionAttribute(Type input, Type output)\n  {\n  }\n\n  public Type ParameterType { get; set; }\n}\n\n\n\n\nLet's examine this attribute in detail:\n\n\n\n\nThe constructor \nValueConversionAttribute(Type input, Type output)\n declares the expected input and output types for a converter.\n\n\nType input\n is the expected \ninput\n type for the value converter. This is the argument \nobject value\n for the \nConvert\n method and the return type for the \nConvertBack\n method.\n\n\nType output\n is the expected \noutput\n type for the value converter. This is the return type for the \nConvert\n method and the argument \nobject value\n for the \nConvertBack\n method.\n\n\nThe property \nType ParameterType\n is the expected \nparamter\n type for the value converter. This is the argument \nobject parameter\n for the \nConvert\n and \nConvertBack\n methods.\n\n\n\n\nTo use the \nValueConversionAttribute\n in our source code, we annotate a value converter at the class level and use the \ntypeof\n operator to provide input, output and parameter types:\n\n\n[ValueConversion(typeof(bool), typeof(Xamarin.Forms.Color))]\npublic class BoolToTextColorConverter : IValueConverter\n{\n    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        return (bool)value ? Color.Black : Color.Red;\n    }\n\n    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe \nBoolToTextColorConverter\n now declares it's intent when converting values to both tooling and other developers; it \nmust\n have a \nbool\n as an input and it \nmust\n return into a \nXamarin.Forms.Color\n type.\n\n\nTo include the \nValueConversionAttribute\n we can simply copy-paste the code into our code base. Alternatively, add a third party library like \nFormsCommunityToolkit.Converters\n that has the \nValueConversionAttribute\n defined.\n\n\nConverter Type-Safety in Xaml\n\n\nWhen an \nIValueConverter\n is annotated with the \nValueConversion\n attribute, we declare to MFractor that our value converter wishes to enforce \ntype safety\n.\n\n\nThis has a few benefits:\n\n\n\n\nMFractor can now verify the types passed into and returned by a \nConverter\n expression are correct in the given context.\n\n\nWhen MFractor is generating a property from a binding expression, it can now extract the type information for a converter and generate that property with the correct type information.\n\n\n\n\nLet's consider our previous example of a provided a string as the input to the \nBoolToTextColorConverter\n:\n\n\nEntry TextColor=\n{Binding Email, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen analysing the \nBinding\n expression, MFractor will inspect for \nConverter\n expressions and then evaluate the inner converter for it's expected input and output type.\n\n\nAs we have provided a \nstring\n but \nBoolToTextColorConverter\n expects a \nbool\n, MFractor will mark this as an error within the Xaml editor:\n\n\n\n\nVoila! We now have type-safety in our Xaml when using value converters! \u2728\u2728\n\n\nAnnotated value converters also allow the refactoring engine to correctly generate properties.\n\n\nFor example, if the our binding context is missing the \nEmail\n property, MFractor will extract the input type from the value converter and use that to generate the binding property:\n\n\n\n\nInstead of using the type of the \nTextColor\n property, MFractor could see that \nBoolToTextColorConverter\n expected a \nbool\n value and then generated the \nEmail\n property with a \nbool\n.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nIn this tutorial we learnt:\n\n\n\n\nWe can annotate implementations of \nIValueConverter\n with a \nValueConversionAttribute\n to declare it's value conversion intent.\n\n\nAnnotated value converters enable MFractor's Xaml analyser to provide type-safety in the Xaml editor.\n\n\nAnnotated value converters enable MFractor's refactoring engine to generate properties with the correct type information.",

Color.Black : Color.Red;\n    }\n\n    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}  And when used in our xaml:  LoginPage.xaml  ?xml version= 1.0  encoding= UTF-8 ?  ContentPage\n        xmlns= http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms \n        xmlns:x= http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml \n        x:Class= MyApp.LoginPage \n        xmlns:converters= clr-namespace:MyApp.Converters;assembly=MyApp \n     ContentPage.Resources \n         ResourceDictionary \n             converters:BoolToTextColorConverter x:Key= boolToTextColorConverter  / \n         /ResourceDictionary \n     /ContentPage.Resources \n     Entry TextColor= {Binding IsEmailValid, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}} /  /ContentPage   Now when the user enters an invalid email, the value converter will translate the  IsEmailValid  boolean property in a  Xamarin.Forms.Color !  But what if we accidentally provided a  string  to the  BoolToTextColorConverter :  Entry TextColor= {Binding Email, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}} /   This creates a runtime bug we won't discover until we build, deploy and navigate to the  LoginPage ; we'll see a type cast exception without a clear indication of the problem.  We can completely avoid this problem by declaring a value converters intent with an  ValueConversionAttribute  to hint to MFractor's Xaml analyser it's expected behaviour.",

            "text": "In WPF, Microsoft provides the  ValueConversionAttribute  that developers can use to describe the input, output and parameter type that an  IValueConverter  expects. This class level annotation declares the intent of a value converter to tools and to other developers using a converter.  Unfortunately this attribute is in the  PresentationFramework  assembly, which we can't reference in a Xamarin.Forms PCL or shared project.  As the  ValueConversionAttribute  is simple in implementation, we can easily make our own:  [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class, AllowMultiple = true)]\npublic class ValueConversionAttribute : Attribute\n{\n  public ValueConversionAttribute(Type input, Type output)\n  {\n  }\n\n  public Type ParameterType { get; set; }\n}  Let's examine this attribute in detail:   The constructor  ValueConversionAttribute(Type input, Type output)  declares the expected input and output types for a converter.  Type input  is the expected  input  type for the value converter. This is the argument  object value  for the  Convert  method and the return type for the  ConvertBack  method.  Type output  is the expected  output  type for the value converter. This is the return type for the  Convert  method and the argument  object value  for the  ConvertBack  method.  The property  Type ParameterType  is the expected  paramter  type for the value converter. This is the argument  object parameter  for the  Convert  and  ConvertBack  methods.   To use the  ValueConversionAttribute  in our source code, we annotate a value converter at the class level and use the  typeof  operator to provide input, output and parameter types:  [ValueConversion(typeof(bool), typeof(Xamarin.Forms.Color))]\npublic class BoolToTextColorConverter : IValueConverter\n{\n    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        return (bool)value ? Color.Black : Color.Red;\n    }\n\n    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}  The  BoolToTextColorConverter  now declares it's intent when converting values to both tooling and other developers; it  must  have a  bool  as an input and it  must  return into a  Xamarin.Forms.Color  type.  To include the  ValueConversionAttribute  we can simply copy-paste the code into our code base. Alternatively, add a third party library like  FormsCommunityToolkit.Converters  that has the  ValueConversionAttribute  defined.",

            "text": "When an  IValueConverter  is annotated with the  ValueConversion  attribute, we declare to MFractor that our value converter wishes to enforce  type safety .  This has a few benefits:   MFractor can now verify the types passed into and returned by a  Converter  expression are correct in the given context.  When MFractor is generating a property from a binding expression, it can now extract the type information for a converter and generate that property with the correct type information.   Let's consider our previous example of a provided a string as the input to the  BoolToTextColorConverter :  Entry TextColor= {Binding Email, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}} /   When analysing the  Binding  expression, MFractor will inspect for  Converter  expressions and then evaluate the inner converter for it's expected input and output type.  As we have provided a  string  but  BoolToTextColorConverter  expects a  bool , MFractor will mark this as an error within the Xaml editor:   Voila! We now have type-safety in our Xaml when using value converters! \u2728\u2728  Annotated value converters also allow the refactoring engine to correctly generate properties.  For example, if the our binding context is missing the  Email  property, MFractor will extract the input type from the value converter and use that to generate the binding property:   Instead of using the type of the  TextColor  property, MFractor could see that  BoolToTextColorConverter  expected a  bool  value and then generated the  Email  property with a  bool .",

If the value is an expression, MFractor will evaluate the expression and use the return type as the new properties type.\n\n\nIf the attributes value isn't an expression, MFractor will attempt to infer type based on the literal input. For example, an attribute value of \ntrue\n would trigger MFractor to output a boolean typed property.

To include this control into our XAML, we need to add the following code into the root XAML node:\n\n\nxmlns:ffimage=\nclr-namespace:FFImageLoading.Forms;assembly=FFImageLoading.Forms\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a few issues with this workflow:\n\n\n\n\nRemembering the \nclr-namespace: ... ;assembly= ...\n syntax is hard!\n\n\nRemembering what namespace and assembly a control is in is hard!\n\n\n\n\nTherefore the \nImport Namespace And Assembly For Unresolved XAML Node\n code fix is very useful because it resolves these for you!\n\n\nThe code action will search all assemblies that the project references for classes that match the name of the XAML node.

For this fix to activate, the following conditions must be fulfilled:   The attribute used on a XAML node does not exist on the .NET class for that node.  The class referenced by the XAML node is within the users source code.   Consider the following code example:  MyCustomControl.cs  public class MyCustomControl : Xamarin.Forms.View\n{\n}  MyPage.xaml  ContentPage xmlns= http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms \n    xmlns:x= http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml \n    x:Class= MyApp.MainPage \n     MyCustomControl OnTappedMessage= The custom control was tapped! /  /ContentPage   The attribute  OnTappedMessage  is attempting to reference a member that does not exist inside  MyCustomControl ; a developer can use this code action to generate that missing member:  MyCustomControl.cs  public class MyCustomControl : Xamarin.Forms.View\n{\n    public string OnTappedMessage { get; set; }\n}  When the class derives from  Xamarin.Forms.View , this code action can be used to generate a bindable property implementation:   The code action will attempt to resolve the new properties type by inspecting the value of the source attribute. If the value is an expression, MFractor will evaluate the expression and use the return type as the new properties type.  If the attributes value isn't an expression, MFractor will attempt to infer type based on the literal input.

For example, consider we wanted to use FFImageLoadings  CachedImage  control like so:       ffimage:CachedImage/   This control lives inside the  FFImageLoading.Forms  namespace in the  FFImageLoading.Forms  assembly. To include this control into our XAML, we need to add the following code into the root XAML node:  xmlns:ffimage= clr-namespace:FFImageLoading.Forms;assembly=FFImageLoading.Forms   There's a few issues with this workflow:   Remembering the  clr-namespace: ... ;assembly= ...  syntax is hard!  Remembering what namespace and assembly a control is in is hard!   Therefore the  Import Namespace And Assembly For Unresolved XAML Node  code fix is very useful because it resolves these for you!

Unfortunately this has a nasty edgecase; \nApplication\n subclasses \nmust\n manually implement the peer connection constructor otherwise the Xamarin.Android runtime cannot instantiate it!\n\n\nConsider the following application subclass:\n\n\nMyApplication.cs\n\n\n[Application(Name=\ncom.companyname.myandroidapp.MyApplication\n, Icon=\n@mipmap/icon\n, Label=\n@string/app_name\n)]\npublic class MyApplication : Application\n{\n    public override void OnCreate()\n    {\n        base.OnCreate();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAt a glance, this seems perfectly reasonable. However, when the \nOnCreate\n method is called by the Xamarin.Android runtime, it generates a \nSystem.NotSupportedException\n when the Java counterpart for the managed \nApplication\n class cannot be bound:\n\n\n\n\nThis can be fixed by implementing the peer connection constructor for the \nApplication\n class:\n\n\nMyApplication.cs\n\n\n[Application(Name = \ncom.companyname.myandroidapp.MyApplication\n, Icon = \n@mipmap/icon\n, Label = \n@string/app_name\n)]\npublic class MyApplication : Application\n{\n    public MyApplication(System.IntPtr javaReference, Android.Runtime.JniHandleOwnership transfer)\n        : base(javaReference, transfer)\n    {\n    }\n\n    public override void OnCreate()\n    {\n        base.OnCreate();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nTo quickly fix this code issue, you can use the \nimplement base class constructors code action\n.\n\n\nRefer To:\n\n\n\n\nHow to register my own Application subclass in Xamarin.Android?\n\n\nWhat is the recipe to have a working Application-derived class?\n\n\n\n\nCheck Android.Content.Res.Resources Usages\n\n\nWhen using the Android.Content.Res.Resources class, all Get* expressions expect the correct resource type identifier. For example, when using Resource.GetString(), a resource identifier of Resources.String.myString is expected. Passing any other resource identifier such as Resource.Color.myColor may result in unintended data being used or runtime exceptions. This code analyser validates that the correct resource type is being provided to the API call.\n\n\nCheck Views Exist In Layout\n\n\nWhen connecting Android layouts (\naxml\n files located under \nResources/Layout\n), developers pull views out of their bound layout with the \nFindViewById\n method.\n\n\nTake this example layout:\n\n\nMain.axml\n\n\nLinearLayout\n\n    \nButton android:id=\n+@id/mainButton\n/\n\n\n/LinearLayout\n\n\n\n\n\nMyActivity.cs\n\n\npublic class MyActivity : Activity\n{\n    public void OnCreate()\n    {\n        SetContentView(Resource.Layout.Main);\n        var button = FindViewById\nButton\n(Resource.Id.mainButton);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe developer is retrieving the \nmainButton\n from the \nMain.axml\n layout that was bound using the \nSetContentView(Resource.Layout.Main)\n invocation.\n\n\nIn large scale applications, as the amount of layouts grows, it becomes very easy to accidentally retrieve the wrong button from the layout.\n\n\nSay another layout defined \nsecondaryButton\n... Consider the following:\n\n\nMyActivity.cs\n\n\npublic class MyActivity : Activity\n{\n    public void OnCreate()\n    {\n        SetContentView(Resource.Layout.Main);\n        var button = FindViewById\nButton\n(Resource.Id.secondaryButton);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe developer is accidentally pulling out the \nsecondaryButton\n id from \nMain.axml\n but \nMain.axml\n defines \nmainButton\n; this will cause a runtime exception when the \nMainActivity\n is created.\n\n\nMFractor provides the \nMFractor.Annotations\n library that lets developers declare their layout uses for a class, enabling MFractor to inspect \nFindViewById\n calls and check that the \nResource.Id\n provided exists in a particular layout.\n\n\nMyActivity.cs\n\n\n[MFractor.Annotations.Android.UsesLayout(Resource.Layout.Main)]\npublic class MyActivity : Activity\n{\n    // ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nMFractor will look for a \nsecondaryButton\n declaration in all configurations of \nMain.axml\n and provide a code warning if it cannot be found:\n\n\n\n\nClass Derives From IJavaObject\n\n\nOften when creating new classes in a Xamarin.Android codebase developers will need a new class to be usable between Java and C#. Xamarin.Android provides the IJavaObject interface to expose a class to Java. Instead of directly inheriting from the IJavaObject interface, a developer should instead inherit from Java.Lang.Object which implements the required interface members.\n\n\nIncorrect Activity Creation\n\n\nThis analyser detects when a developer is instantiating an Android activity or activity subclass directly using a new expression. Activities should only ever be created through the operating system; creating them through a new expression leaves them in an invalid state.\n\n\nValidate Cheeseknife Attributes\n\n\nThis analyser inspect usages of attributes from the Cheeseknife view injection library; it validates that the Resource.Id.* exists in the layout provided into an MFractor.Annotations UsesLayout attribute.\n\n\nVerify Toast Is Shown\n\n\nSometimes when a Toast is created via MakeText, the Show method is accidently omitted. This analysis routine looks for invocations of Toast.MakeText() that don't then invoke the Show() method on the toast object in the same expression. If the MakeText() result is assigned into a variable or passed as a method argument then this check is skipped.\n\n\nWarn Of Static Context References\n\n\nThis analyser inspects static variable declarations within classes and checks if the type derives from Android.Content.Context. Static context references have the potential to cause large memory leaks.",

Unfortunately this has a nasty edgecase;  Application  subclasses  must  manually implement the peer connection constructor otherwise the Xamarin.Android runtime cannot instantiate it!  Consider the following application subclass:  MyApplication.cs  [Application(Name= com.companyname.myandroidapp.MyApplication , Icon= @mipmap/icon , Label= @string/app_name )]\npublic class MyApplication : Application\n{\n    public override void OnCreate()\n    {\n        base.OnCreate();\n    }\n}  At a glance, this seems perfectly reasonable. However, when the  OnCreate  method is called by the Xamarin.Android runtime, it generates a  System.NotSupportedException  when the Java counterpart for the managed  Application  class cannot be bound:   This can be fixed by implementing the peer connection constructor for the  Application  class:  MyApplication.cs  [Application(Name =  com.companyname.myandroidapp.MyApplication , Icon =  @mipmap/icon , Label =  @string/app_name )]\npublic class MyApplication : Application\n{\n    public MyApplication(System.IntPtr javaReference, Android.Runtime.JniHandleOwnership transfer)\n        : base(javaReference, transfer)\n    {\n    }\n\n    public override void OnCreate()\n    {\n        base.OnCreate();\n    }\n}  To quickly fix this code issue, you can use the  implement base class constructors code action .

You can now tap Alt+Return in Xaml documents to quickly access any fixes or refactorings at that location, the xaml analyser has been tuned for speed and a new code issue tooltip gives deeper insight into the code issue beneath it:\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nThe quick fix menu is now available to quickly access all Xaml actions. Tap Alt+Return in your Xaml document for a list of available code actions to appear!\n\n\nThe xaml analyser integration has been rebuilt and as such, xaml analysis is now much, much quicker. You might notice that fixable issues no longer underline in yellow; the check for available fixes is now.\n\n\nAn improved code issue tooltip now appears when you hover over a xaml or android resource. This tooltip tells you what kind of error it is (Compile time, runtime or code improvement), presents information on the issue and let's you know if any fixes are available.\n\n\n\n\nEnhancements\n\n\n\n\nImprove the can execute checking algorithms for all code actions (refactorings, issue fixes etc) to reduce the noise in the quick fix menu.\n\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n\n\n\n\nFixed: When generating a view model and the view has bindings against an unknown class, previously these bindings would be missed.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Notes - v2.9.4\n\n\n22nd February 2017\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThis is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.9.4 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.\n\n\nImportant: If Visual Studio Mac loses IntelliSense/Code Completion when you update to cycle 9 (XS v6.2), uninstall MFractor and upgrade to the latest version\n\n\nThis release focuses on keeping your Xaml tidy... you can now rename xaml namespaces, align the naming of duplicate namespace imports and format your entire Xaml document.\n\n\nIt's also easier than ever to build out custom controls, the new \nImplement Missing Members\n code generator can bulk implement properties or bindable properties onto custom views in your Xaml.

Generate views, classes and value converters in only a few clicks...\n\n\nJust right click on that little yellow squiggle and use the fix to generate a whole lotta code.\n\n\nThere are also more xaml code checks to watch out for nasty Xaml issues and bug fixes galore.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nNew code generation actions:\n\n\nGenerate classes from \nmy_namespace:MyMissingClass\n in xaml.\n\n\nGenerate views from \nmy_namespace:MyMissingView\n in xaml.\n\n\nGenerate value converters when a missing xaml node ends with \"[cC]onverter] in xaml.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Xaml analysers:\n\n\nFor generics, validate that an x:TypeArguments attribute or xml node setter exists.\n\n\nFor generics, validate that the count of parameters provided to x:TypeArguments matches the generics signature.\n\n\nValidate the root xaml node contains an x:Class directive to set the code behind class name and namespace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhancements\n\n\n\n\nThis release targets Visual Studio Mac v6.1.1\n\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n\n\n\n\nFix a bug in xaml namespace resolution that prevented the \"import new xmlns\" fix from triggering.\n\n\nAllow importing of xaml namespaces from x:Static symbols.\n\n\nFor Setters, don't validate TargetType property that the provided type is a static member of System.Type.\n\n\nWhen a symbol name matches but its in the wrong namespace, don't suggest it as a fix.\n\n\nRemove the MFractor settings panel to fix the Visual Studio Mac preferences dialog from not opening when it didn't exist.\n\n\nWhen using native view declaration, the xaml symbolicator will now honor the targetPlatform flag and find the assembly for that platform. Previously this was a naive search that used the first assembly found; using the wrong symbols if a assembly of the same name existed in both an iOS and Android project.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Notes - v2.5.3\n\n\n10th of October 2016\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThis is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.5.3 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.\n\n\nThis release adds support for native view declaration and property generation for missing view attributes.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nGenerate properties and bindable properties onto classes that implement Xamarin.Forms.ObservableObject.\n\n\nFull support for native view declaration. Tooltips, go-to declaration, xaml analysis and code generation enabled on native views used in Xaml.\n\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n\n\n\n\nXaml expressions now parsed on attributes that cannot be resolved to a .NET symbol. This enables Tooltips, go-to declaration, xaml analysis and code generation.\n\n\nThe analysis engine no longer assumes that the Xamarin.Forms and Microsoft schemas are the implicit and 'x' namespaces. This means that Xamarin.Forms could be remapped to xmlns:xf etc and the xaml analyser will still function correctly.",

For Setters, don't validate TargetType property that the provided type is a static member of System.Type.  When a symbol name matches but its in the wrong namespace, don't suggest it as a fix.  Remove the MFractor settings panel to fix the Visual Studio Mac preferences dialog from not opening when it didn't exist.  When using native view declaration, the xaml symbolicator will now honor the targetPlatform flag and find the assembly for that platform. Previously this was a naive search that used the first assembly found; using the wrong symbols if a assembly of the same name existed in both an iOS and Android project.",
