This is accomplished through \ndata binding\n; properties on a view are bound to properties on a backing object through binding mechanisms allowing two-way data transfer between the UI and application logic. For a full tutorial on Mvvm architecture, please Microsofts \nThe Mvvm Pattern\n article.\n\n\nWhen working with Xaml, we can specify a binding context to activate binding expression analysis and a variety of BindingContext specific refactorings.\n\n\nWe can specify a binding context \nexplicitly\n via in inline Xaml expression or \nimplicitly\n through the use of common MVVM naming conventions.\n\n\nExplicit Binding Context Resolution\n\n\nIn Xamarin.Forms, all views have the property \nBindingContext\n; this specifies the object that a view should data-bind with. When coding with Xaml, we can use the \nx:Static\n markup extension to reference a static C# property and explicitly provide an instance of a C# class as the binding context:\n\n\n \nEntry BindingContext=\n{x:Static local:MyStaticClass.MyStaticProperty}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is known as the \nView Model Locator Pattern\n. We implement a static class named \nViewModelLocator\n and use a static, readonly property to return an instance of the object we want our Xaml view to data-bind with. Historically the \nView Model Locator Pattern\n has been used to provide design time data to the Xamarin.Forms Xaml previewer. For a deeper insight into this pattern, read James Montemagnos excellent \nView Model Locator\n article.\n\n\nFor example, given a Xaml page named \nLoginPage\n, we can explicitly provide an instance of \nLoginViewModel\n as the binding context like so:\n\n\nViewModelLocator.cs\n\n\npublic namespace MyApp\n{\n  public static class ViewModelLocator\n  {\n      public static readonly LoginViewModel LoginViewModel = new LoginViewModel();\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml\n\n\nContentPage\n  xmlns:local=\nclr-namespace:MyApp;assembly=MyApp\n\n  BindingContext=\n{x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor begins analysis on LoginPage.xaml it will check if any \nBindingContext\n properties have been assigned to. As the root \nContentPage\n assigns a binding context, it will inspect the value component of the \nBindingContext\n attribute, check if it is a Xaml expression and then evaluate it for the return type.\n\n\nFor the \n{x:Static local:ViewModelLocator.LoginViewModel}\n expression, MFractor will resolve the \nViewModelLocator\n class in the \nlocal\n namespace and then grab the C# type of the \nLoginViewModel\n property. This informs MFractor that the page will be bound to a \nLoginViewModel\n instance and therefore to analyse all \nBinding\n expressions against the \nLoginViewModel\n type.\n\n\nExplicit binding context resolution will also work when referencing another element using \nx:Reference\n expressions. For example, we can bind the on/off state of a switch to the visibility of a text label like so:\n\n\n  \nSwitch x:Name=\nmySwitch\n /\n\n  \nLabel BindingContext=\n{x:Reference mySwitch}\n IsVisible=\n{Binding IsToggled}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor analyses the \n{Binding IsToggled}\n expression, it will evaluate the \n{x:Reference mySwitch}\n expression and use the type of mySwitch as the BindingContext (Xamarin.Forms.Switch).\n\n\nImplicit Binding Context Resolution\n\n\nIn addition to explicit binding context resolution, MFractor will attempt to infer the relationship between your view models and xaml views via \nimplicit binding context resolution\n. This is done by looking for classes and Xaml views that share a common naming convention.\n\n\nLet's consider the following files:\n\n\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml\n - The xaml view.\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n - The code behind for the xaml view.\n\n\nLoginViewModel\n - The a C# class that is the view model for the LoginPage view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause these pages share the prefix \nLogin\n and each has a distinct file extension or suffix, we can infer the following relationships:\n\n\n\n\nThe \n.xaml\n extension denotes that \nLoginPage.xaml\n is a xaml view.\n\n\nThe \n.xaml.cs\n extension and the \nLoginPage\n component denotes that \nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n is the code behind implementation \nLoginPage\n view.\n\n\nThe \nViewModel\n suffix implies that \nLoginViewModel\n is a view model. When \nViewModel\n is removed from \nLoginViewModel\n and \nPage\n is removed from \nLoginPage\n, the \nLogin\n component implies that the \nLoginViewModel\n is related to the \nLoginPage\n xaml view and it's code behind file.\n\n\n\n\nMFractor uses these common naming conventions of Page.xaml, Page.xaml.cs and ViewModel to decide that \nLoginViewModel\n will probably be the BindingContext for \nLoginPage\n. It will then\n\n\nThe following suffixes are supported for Xaml views:\n\n\n\n\nPage\n: EG LoginPage.xaml \n-\n LoginViewModel\n\n\nView\n: EG LoginView.xaml \n-\n LoginViewModel\n\n\n\n\nExplicit binding context resolution will \nalways\n override implicit binding context resolution. If your xaml views are named using the conventions listed above but your page or a view explicitly assigns the \nBindingContext\n property then MFractor will use the \nBindingContext\n return type instead of the implicit Mvvm relationship.\n\n\nData Template Binding Context Resolution\n\n\nData templates are used to provide a nested Xaml view to a view that displays many occurances of that view. For example, a ListView uses a \nDataTemplate\n to specify the view appearance of each instance provided through the \nItemsSource\n property.\n\n\nMFractor will attempt to infer the BindingContext for a data templates view by resolving the \nItemsSource\n property on the wrapping view.\n\n\nConsider the following code:\n\n\n  \nListView ItemsSource=\n{Binding Contacts}\n\n      \nListView.ItemTemplate\n\n        \nDataTemplate\n\n          \nTextCell Text=\n{Binding DisplayName}\n /\n\n        \n/DataTemplate\n\n      \n/ListView.ItemTemplate\n\n  \n/ListView\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inner \nDataTemplate\n has a \nTextCell\n where the \nText\n property is provided by the binding expression \n{Binding DisplayName}\n. To analyse this expression, MFractor requires a binding context; MFractor will walk out to the encapsulating view (ListView), locate the \nItemsSource\n property and evaluate the expression.\n\n\nWhen the return type is an \nIEnumerable\n or array, MFractor unwraps the generic or array and grabs the inner type. This provides the binding context type for the binding expressions used within the data template.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nIn summary, we've learnt that MFractor will use the binding context to power the Xaml analyser and navigation improvements.\n\n\n\n\nBinding expressions require a binding context to be analysed.\n\n\nWe can explicitly specify a binding context by assigning the \nBindingContext\n property of any Xaml element.\n\n\nWhen we name our code files using the Page.xaml, Page.xaml.cs and ViewModel convention, MFractor will assume an implicit MVVM relationship.\n\n\nData templates use the return type of the wrapping views \nItemSource\n property.",

The naming convention will be [XamlFileName]ViewMode minus the Page or View comoponent; for example, LoginPage would create a class named LoginViewModel and PasswordDialogView would create a class named PasswordDialogViewModel.\n\n\nGenerate\n\n\nGenerate Resource Dictionary\n\n\n Scope: Xml Node \n\n\nThe \nGenerate Resource Dictionary\n refactoring adds a \nMyView.ResourceDictionary\n property with a nested resource dictionary to any Xaml node that derives from \nXamarin.Forms.VisualElement\n or is the root application class. Developers can quickly add a resource dictionary in just a few keystrokes; this is especially useful when you need to add a resource dictionary to the root xaml node on a control or page.\n\n\nOrganise\n\n\nCollapse Attributes Onto Same Line\n\n\n Scope: Xml Node \n\n\nThis refactoring will collapse all the attributes for a Xaml node onto the same line as the nodes name declaration.\n\n\nCollapse Node\n\n\n Scope: Xml Node \n\n\nWhen a Xaml node has a closing tag and no children (eg: \nMyNode\n \n/MyNode\n), this refactoring allows the developer to remove the closing tag to make the node self-closing. For example, when applied to the node \nMyNode\n ... \n/MyNode\n, the closing tag \n/MyNode\n is removed and the element becomes self closing like so: \nMyNode/\n.\n\n\nExpand Attributes Onto Separate Lines\n\n\n Scope: Xml Node \n\n\nThis refactoring will expand all the attributes for a Xaml node onto a separate line for each attribute.\n\n\nExpand Node\n\n\n Scope: Xml Node \n\n\nWhen a Xaml node is self-closing (EG \nMyNode/\n), this organise refactoring allows a developer to generate a closing tag for the node. For example, the node \nMyNode/\n would become \nMyNode\n ... \n/MyNode\n after applying this refactoring.\n\n\nSimplify Static Member Assignment\n\n\n Scope: Xml Attribute \n\n\nAttributes that accept a class instance can be assigned long hand by using the type and instance name that will be used for the assignement.For example, when assigning VerticalOptions it's perfectly reasonable to use the long hand form of 'LayoutOptions.CentreAndExpand'.This refactoring action strips out the leading type specifier and reduces the assignment to just 'CentreAndExpand'\n\n\nSort Xaml Attributes\n\n\n Scope: Xml Node \n\n\nThis refactoring sorts the attributes for a Xaml node and regenerates the xaml node based on the IDE's xml formatting policy.\nMFractor uses the following rules when sorting:\n\n\n\n\nAttributes that declare an xml namespace are ordered first, sorted alphabetically ascending. For example \nxmlns:forms=\"http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms\"\n will appear before \nxmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml\"\n.\n\n\nAttributes that belong to the Microsoft Xaml schema \nhttp://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml\n are ordered next. For example, the \nx:Class\n or \nx:Name\n declaration.\n\n\nAttributes belonging to the default namespace are ordered next, sorted alphabetically ascending.\n\n\nAttributes belonging to the other namespaces are then ordered next, sorted by namespace ascending and then by attribute name ascending.",

For example, a res/menu xml file may only contain 'menu', 'item' and 'group' elements.\n\n\nCheck For Invalid Characters In Value Resource Names\n\n\nChecks that the 'name' attribute for value based resources do not contain invalid characters. Any character apart for 0-9, a-z, A-Z, '.' and '_' are considered to be an invalid character. This check prevents characters that are also operators (such as +, * or \n) from being baked into the Resource.Designer.cs file when the resource ids are generated.\n\n\nCheck For Required Value\n\n\nChecks that the input argument for an XML attribute matches the required value for that attribute. For example, 'xmlns:android' must always be 'http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android'.\n\n\nAvailable Fixes\n\n\n\n\nApply Required Value\n: Replaces an attributes value with the required value for xml element. For example, 'xmlns:android' must always be 'http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android'.\n\n\n\n\nCheck NFC Tech-List for whitespace\n\n\nLooks at the 'tech' elements inside an nfc 'tech-list' definition and verifies that they do not containi whitespace. The loader for tech-list elements is very strict and will cause a runtime exception when this tech-list is used. See https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=65351\n\n\nCheck Public Android Resource Usage\n\n\nInspects Android resource usages and ensure that the resource referenced has been declared as public.\n\n\nCheck Reference Type\n\n\nVerifies that an attribute that expects a resource reference is provided a reference expression (@type/value) rather than a literal value.\n\n\nCircular Resource Usage\n\n\nDetects when a resource usage (@type/value) that points to a file based resource (such as a layout or drawable) will generate a circular reference when it is inflated. A common example of this is using \ninclude\n or \nmerge\n tags inside a layout that also references other layouts via merging or including.\n\n\nClass Reference Exists\n\n\nChecks that a DotNet class referenced in xml exists in the current solution and its references.\n\n\nAvailable Fixes\n\n\n\n\nCorrect Unknown Class Reference\n: Replaces an invalid class reference with one that is closely named.\n\n\n\n\nDeclarative ID In Style\n\n\nDefining a style which sets android:id to a dynamically generated id can cause many versions of aapt, the resource packaging tool, to crash. To work around this, declare the id explicitly with \nitem type=\"id\" name=\"...\" /\n instead.\n\n\nDetect Duplicate Plurals Entries\n\n\nInspects a 'plurals' resource entry for 'item' elements that have the same 'quantity' value.\n\n\nDetect Resource Self Reference\n\n\nAnalyses resources usages to detect when a usage attempts to reference itself. This error is most likely to occur when using animations, drawables and particularly for layout includes.\n\n\nDrawable 9-patch reference check.\n\n\nChecks that a drawable reference does not end with '.9'.\n\n\nAvailable Fixes\n\n\n\n\nFix 9-patch drawable references\n: Replaces a nine patch drawable reference that includes the '.9' suffix with a reference that excludes the '.9' suffix.\n\n\n\n\nInconsistent Array Sizes\n\n\nChecks that 'array', 'string-array' and 'integer-array' resources with multiple declarations all have the same number of elements across all locales they are declared in.\n\n\nItem Value Resource Is Valid\n\n\nChecks that the content contained within an \n tag that declares a value resource declaration is a valid format for its type.\n\n\nLayout \n exists in configuration\n\n\nChecks that usages of 'include' tags within a Android layout reference a layout that is available within the current configuration.\n\n\nLayout Width And Height Required\n\n\nChecks that layout elements have both the 'android:layout_width' and 'android:layout_height' attributes declared. Elements that are missing these attributes will generate a runtime exception when the layout is inflated.\n\n\nMispelt Resource Type References\n\n\nChecks that the resource references (EG: @string/myString) have a valid resource type component and suggests an auto-correction if possible.\n\n\nAvailable Fixes\n\n\n\n\nFix Mispelt Resource Usages\n: Replaces unresolvable resource usages with an auto-suggested value based on the resources available in the project or its references.\n\n\n\n\nMultiple \n usages in manifest\n\n\nInspects the \n element within the Android manifest for multiple declarations of the \n element. Only a single \n element is allowed.\n\n\nNode Missing Required Attributes\n\n\nChecks that a given resource node has all the mandatory attributes.\n\n\nAvailable Fixes\n\n\n\n\nAdd Required Attributes\n: Adds any missing required attributes and their default values to an xml node.\n\n\n\n\nResource Value Format\n\n\nValidates that a resource value (such as a dimension, color or percentage) is entered in the correct format.\n\n\nAvailable Fixes\n\n\n\n\nFix Value Format\n: Fixes typeos for inline values such as dimensions, color or floats.\n\n\n\n\nScroll View Has Multiple Children\n\n\nVerifies that a ScrollView only has 1 direct child; multiple children will cause a runtime exception when the layout is inflated. If you want more children, encapsulate the child elements into a layout container.\n\n\nTextView 'textSize' uses non-sp dimension\n\n\nInspects 'textSize' attributes for usages of non-sp dimensions\n\n\nValid Keyword Input\n\n\nValidates that a keyword or sequence of flags provided to an xml attribute are valid. For instance, the installation location is doen by the 'android:installLocation' manifest attribute. This attribute only accepts 'internalOnly', 'auto' and 'preferExternal', any other value is a compilation error.\n\n\nAvailable Fixes\n\n\n\n\nFix Keywords\n: Replaces a mispelt keyword with an auto-corrected suggestion or suggests from a list of valid keywords.\n\n\n\n\nValidate Animated Vectors Reference Vector Drawables\n\n\nVerifies that the 'android:drawable' attribute on an 'animated-vector' drawable resource points to a 'vector' base drawable.\n\n\nValidate Flag Input\n\n\nValidates that any flags provided to an xml attribute are valid.\n\n\nAvailable Fixes\n\n\n\n\nFix Flags\n: Replaces a mispelt flag with an auto-corrected suggestion or suggests from a list of valid keywords.\n\n\n\n\nValidate quotations in \n elements.\n\n\nVerifies that quotation marks (' and \") are properly escaped when inside a string resource. For instance, single quotes (') must be escaped by a preceeding '\\' unless the whole string is wrapped within double quotes (\"). Furthermore, the use of double quotes must be escaped unless they enclose the entire string.\n\n\nValues Resource Is Valid\n\n\nChecks that the content contained within a value resource declaration is a valid format for its type.\n\n\nVerify Input Type\n\n\nChecks that a xml attribute accepts the resource type used in a reference expression (EG: @string/myString).\n\n\nVerify Max API Feature Usages\n\n\nChecks that xml resources use Android SDK features that are within the projects Target API level.\n\n\nVerify Resource Exists\n\n\nChecks that a resource used via a reference expression (EG: @string/myString) exists within the project or its references.",

Xamarin.Forms also facilitates shared UI code through the use of an xml based view markup langauge named Xaml.\n\n\nDevelopers build their UI views in Xaml and Xamarin.Forms then inflate the view into it\u2019s native implementation.\n\n\nAlongside shared UI code, Xamarin.Forms uses the Model \u2013 View \u2013 View Model (Mvvm) design pattern to seperate a UI definition it\u2019s from state/behaviour code.\n\n\nThe Mvvm design pattern is a great for maintainabilty and code clarity however developers can spend a lot of time manually nagivating between Xaml views and an associated view model.\n\n\nMFractor adds several navigation shortcuts to speed up developers.\n\n\nGetting Started\nIn this article we will use MFractor to navigate between a Xaml UI definition, it\u2019s code behind class and its associated view model.\n\n\nWe assume the following:\n\n\n\n\nA Xamarin Studio 6.0 installation.\n\n\nMFractor installed into Xamarin Studio.

Open it up in Xamarin Studio and take a look at the project structure:\n\n\nMFractor For Xamarin.Forms Project\n\n\nThe project itself is trivial; it has a single xaml page with a code behind class and 2 view view models; WelcomeViewModel and GoodbyeViewModel. Notice that this project appends Xaml views with with \u201cPage\u201d and view models with \u201cViewModel\u201d.\n\n\nBefore we get started learning how to use the Mvvm navigation shortcuts, let\u2019s understand the conventions that MFractor uses to drive the navigation.\n\n\nThe \u201cPage/View\" and \"ViewModel\" naming convention\n\n\nIn Xamarin.Forms, the de-facto naming convention is to append views with Page or View and view models are appended with ViewModel.\n\n\nThis naming standard implies that the WelcomePage and the WelcomeViewModel are associated; if we stripped off Page and ViewModel from the file names then both would be named Welcome. This implicit relationship makes the codebase easier to understand by conforming to industry standards.\n\n\nMFractor notices this implicit relationship; if a view and a view model within the same assembly are named like this, a MFractor activates shortcuts between the view, it\u2019s code behind and the associated view model.\n\n\nIf developers don\u2019t want this implicit relationship or their Views/View Models are in seperate assemblies, they may explicitly specify the binding context in the view\u2019s Xaml using the View Model Locator pattern.\n\n\nThe ViewModelLocator Pattern\n\n\nThe ViewModelLocator pattern is a static class used to specify the BindingContext of a Xaml view for design time previewing. James Montemagno re-introduced this concept in his blog post for the Xaml Previewer.\n\n\nDevelopers implement a static class named ViewModelLocator that exposes a static instance of their view models:\n\n\npublic static class ViewModelLocator\n{\n    static MyViewModel _myViewModel;\n    public static MyViewModel MyViewModel =\n _myViewModel ?? (_myViewModel = new MyViewModel());\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis static instance is then bound to the Xaml\u2019s binding context via an x:Static expression:\n\n\n    xmlns:design=\nclr-namespace:MyAppNamespace;assembly=MyApp\n\n    BindingContext=\n{x:Static design:ViewModelLocator.MyViewModel}\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the BindingContext for a view is explicitly defined, MFractor will honor this relationship and route all Mvvm navigation to the view model class declaration defined by the ViewModelLocator.\n\n\nFor the sample project, we could retarget the WecomePage to link with the GoodbyeViewModel by exposing a static instance through the ViewModelLocator and referencing it using the BindingContext:\n\n\nC#\n\n\npublic static class ViewModelLocator\n{\n    static GoodbyeViewModel _goodebye;\n    public static GoodbyeViewModel GoodbyeViewModel =\n _goodebye ?? (_goodebye = new GoodbyeViewModel());\n}\n\n\n\n\nXaml\n\n\n    xmlns:design=\nclr-namespace:MFractorForForms;assembly=MFractorForForms\n\n    BindingContext=\n{x:Static design:ViewModelLocator.GoodbyeViewModel}\n\n\n\n\n\nFluid Mvvm Navigation\n\n\nNow that we understand how MFractor links the Mvvm code files, let\u2019s get to know the Mvvm navigation shortcuts.\n\n\nOpen up the WelcomePage.xaml and right click in the middle of the editor:\n\n\nMvvm Shortcuts\n\n\nThere are 3 Mvvm navigation shortcuts in MFractor:\n\n\n\n\nGo To Code-Behind Class: Jumps you to the code behind class related to a view or view model\n\n\nGo To View Model: Jumps you to the view model related to a view or code behind class.\n\n\nGo To Xaml View: Jumps you to the xaml view related to a view model or code behind class.\n\n\n\n\nWe can use these short-cuts to quickly navigate around these 3 files:\n\n\nOr we can use an xStatic expression that uses the ViewModelLocator to target a different view model implementation:\n\n\nCustom Binding Context\n\n\nNow the Go To View Model shortcut will instead jump to the class type used by the BindingContext rather than the implicit association.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nWe\u2019ve learnt how to use MFractors Mvvm navigation shortcuts to quickly move between the View, Code Behind Class and View Model\n\n\nTo continue learning to use MFractor, visit our documentation page.",

If developers don\u2019t want this implicit relationship or their Views/View Models are in seperate assemblies, they may explicitly specify the binding context in the view\u2019s Xaml using the View Model Locator pattern.",

            "text": "The ViewModelLocator pattern is a static class used to specify the BindingContext of a Xaml view for design time previewing. James Montemagno re-introduced this concept in his blog post for the Xaml Previewer.  Developers implement a static class named ViewModelLocator that exposes a static instance of their view models:  public static class ViewModelLocator\n{\n    static MyViewModel _myViewModel;\n    public static MyViewModel MyViewModel =  _myViewModel ?? (_myViewModel = new MyViewModel());\n}  This static instance is then bound to the Xaml\u2019s binding context via an x:Static expression:      xmlns:design= clr-namespace:MyAppNamespace;assembly=MyApp \n    BindingContext= {x:Static design:ViewModelLocator.MyViewModel}   When the BindingContext for a view is explicitly defined, MFractor will honor this relationship and route all Mvvm navigation to the view model class declaration defined by the ViewModelLocator.  For the sample project, we could retarget the WecomePage to link with the GoodbyeViewModel by exposing a static instance through the ViewModelLocator and referencing it using the BindingContext:  C#  public static class ViewModelLocator\n{\n    static GoodbyeViewModel _goodebye;\n    public static GoodbyeViewModel GoodbyeViewModel =  _goodebye ?? (_goodebye = new GoodbyeViewModel());\n}  Xaml      xmlns:design= clr-namespace:MFractorForForms;assembly=MFractorForForms \n    BindingContext= {x:Static design:ViewModelLocator.GoodbyeViewModel}",

This is a Xamarin.Forms API that implements the \nIMarkupExtension interface\n; it reflects changes from the binding context to the view and vice-versa.\n\n\nWe use the binding markup extension syntax in our Xaml views:\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Username}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nLoginViewModel.cs\n\n\npublic class LoginViewModel\n{\n  public string Username { get; set; }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn the above example, \n{Binding Username}\n points to a public property on the \nLogingPage\ns binding context, the \nLoginViewModel\n.

This shortcut collects \nall\n missing binding expressions (excluding bindings inside DataTemplates) and generates them in bulk onto the binding context.\n\n\nWe can access this short cut by right clicking anywhere in a Xaml file, navigating to \nGenerate\n and then selecting the \nImplement View Model\n action:\n\n\n\n\nYou'll notice that there are 2 actions:\n\n\n\n\nImplement View Model\n gathers all missing bindings in the xaml document and implements them all as public properties with a public \nget\n and \nset\n accessor.\n\n\nImplement View Model (Use Backing Fields)\n gathers all missing bindings in the xaml document and implements them all as public properties with a public \nget\n and \nset\n accessor that sets or gets a backing field.\n\n\n\n\nThere are often cases when a binding context isn't specified \nexplicitly \n and can't be inferred \nimplicitly\n. A common example of this is that you have just started to build a Xaml view and haven't yet got around to building the corresponding view model.\n\n\nThe \nImplement View Model\n action can also generate a view model class for the Xaml view if one is not already defined. Using Mvvm naming conventions, MFractor generates a view model class for your xaml view under the \nMyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n namespace.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml.cs\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Username}\n/\n\n\nEntry Text=\n{Binding Password}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen creating the view model class, MFractor removes the \nPage\n or \nView\n suffix from the view name and then attaches \nViewModel\n to the end of the resulting name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove the \nPage\n or \nView\n suffix: LoginPage -\n Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttach the \nViewModel\n suffix: Login -\n LoginViewModel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a new class named \nLoginViewModel\n under the namespace \nMyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would result in the following view model class file:\n\n\nLoginViewModel.cs\n\n\npublic namespace MyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n{\n  public class LoginViewModel\n  {\n    public string Username { get; set; }\n    public string Password { get; set; }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you project references Fody's \nImplementPropertyChanged\n extension, the default getter / setter implementation will also annotate the result with the \n[ImplementPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged]\n attribute:\n\n\nLoginViewModel.cs\n\n\n[ImplementPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged]\npublic class LoginViewModel\n{\n}\n\n\n\n\nGenerating Commands Implementations\n\n\nWhen MFractor encounters a property that expects the \nSystem.Windows.Input.ICommand\n interface, it will generate a property returning a empty command implementation.\n\n\nFor example, we bind our login button to a \nLoginCommand\n property on our view model:\n\n\nButton Command=\n{Binding LoginCommand}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen MFractor generates the property for \nLoginCommand\n, it creates an empty command implementation:\n\n\npublic System.Windows.Input.ICommand LoginCommand\n{\n    get\n    {\n        return new Xamarin.Forms.Command(() =\n\n        {\n            throw new NotImplementedException();\n        }\n\n        );\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nBinding Generation And Value Converters\n\n\nWhen a binding expression uses a \nConverter\n, MFractor will attempt to resolve the input type of the referenced value converter and use that as the property type. We must have a value conversion attribute on the \nIValueConverter\n for MFractor to resolve the input type. Please read the \nValue Conversion Type-Safety\n tutorial to learn more.\n\n\nFor example, we add a login button that is only enabled when the user has their password entered:\n\n\nResourceDictionary\n\n    \nlocal:StringToBoolConverter x:Key=\nstringToBoolConverter\n /\n\n\n/ResourceDictionary\n\n\n\nButton IsEnabled=\n{Binding Password, Converter={StaticResource stringToBoolConverter}}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nProvided that \nstringToBoolConverter\n is annotated to accept string inputs and return a boolean output, MFractor can still generate \nPassword\n as a string even though \nIsEnabled\n is a boolean property.\n\n\nIf there is no value conversion information on the value converter, MFractor will default to \nSysten.Object\n as the type for our property:\n\n\npublic System.Object Password\n{\n  get; set;\n}\n\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\nThere are a some limitations in the \nImplement View Model\n refactoring:\n\n\n\n\nWhen a Xaml view has an item that uses a \nDataTemplate\n to declare an inline view, MFractor \nwill not\n gather the bindings inside the data template. A refactoring action to generate bindings for data templates will be coming in a future MFractor release.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nBy building our apps using the \nXaml first\n mindset, we can leverage MFractor's binding generation to implement our view models quickly.\n\n\nIn this tutorial we learnt:\n\n\n\n\nWe can generate entire view models using the \nImplement View Model\n refactoring action.\n\n\nWe can generate single properties using code issue fixing.\n\n\nWe need a binding context to activate binding expression analysis and issue fixing.\n\n\nWhen a binding uses a value converter, MFractor use the correct type when the converter has a value conversion attribute.",

But what if we had a screen with an email entry that needs to change color when the user enters a valid email?\n\n\nEnter the \nIValueConverter interface\n; value converters transform one data type to another.\n\n\nWe can expose a boolean \nIsEmailValid\n on our binding context, bind the \nTextColor\n field of the entry to the \nIsEmailValid\n property and use an \nIValueConverter\n that converts a \nTrue\n value to black and a \nFalse\n value to red.\n\n\nOur converter would look like this:\n\n\npublic class BoolToTextColorConverter : IValueConverter\n{\n    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        return (bool)value ? Color.Black : Color.Red;\n    }\n\n    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAnd when used in our xaml:\n\n\nLoginPage.xaml\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nUTF-8\n?\n\n\nContentPage\n        xmlns=\nhttp://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms\n\n        xmlns:x=\nhttp://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml\n\n        x:Class=\nMyApp.LoginPage\n\n        xmlns:converters=\nclr-namespace:MyApp.Converters;assembly=MyApp\n\n    \nContentPage.Resources\n\n        \nResourceDictionary\n\n            \nconverters:BoolToTextColorConverter x:Key=\nboolToTextColorConverter\n /\n\n        \n/ResourceDictionary\n\n    \n/ContentPage.Resources\n\n    \nEntry TextColor=\n{Binding IsEmailValid, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}}\n/\n\n\n/ContentPage\n\n\n\n\n\nNow when the user enters an invalid email, the value converter will translate the \nIsEmailValid\n boolean property in a \nXamarin.Forms.Color\n!\n\n\nBut what if we accidentally provided a \nstring\n to the \nBoolToTextColorConverter\n:\n\n\nEntry TextColor=\n{Binding Email, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nThis creates a runtime bug we won't discover until we build, deploy and navigate to the \nLoginPage\n; we'll see a type cast exception without a clear indication of the problem.\n\n\nWe can completely avoid this problem by declaring a value converters intent with an \nValueConversionAttribute\n to hint to MFractor's Xaml analyser it's expected behaviour.\n\n\nThe ValueConversion Attribute\n\n\nIn WPF, Microsoft provides the \nValueConversionAttribute\n that developers can use to describe the input, output and parameter type that an \nIValueConverter\n expects. This class level annotation declares the intent of a value converter to tools and to other developers using a converter.\n\n\nUnfortunately this attribute is in the \nPresentationFramework\n assembly, which we can't reference in a Xamarin.Forms PCL or shared project.\n\n\nAs the \nValueConversionAttribute\n is simple in implementation, we can easily make our own:\n\n\n[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class, AllowMultiple = true)]\npublic class ValueConversionAttribute : Attribute\n{\n  public ValueConversionAttribute(Type input, Type output)\n  {\n  }\n\n  public Type ParameterType { get; set; }\n}\n\n\n\n\nLet's examine this attribute in detail:\n\n\n\n\nThe constructor \nValueConversionAttribute(Type input, Type output)\n declares the expected input and output types for a converter.\n\n\nType input\n is the expected \ninput\n type for the value converter.

Typically, the type on the control's property matches the type on the binding context property. But what if we had a screen with an email entry that needs to change color when the user enters a valid email?  Enter the  IValueConverter interface ; value converters transform one data type to another.  We can expose a boolean  IsEmailValid  on our binding context, bind the  TextColor  field of the entry to the  IsEmailValid  property and use an  IValueConverter  that converts a  True  value to black and a  False  value to red.  Our converter would look like this:  public class BoolToTextColorConverter : IValueConverter\n{\n    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        return (bool)value ? Color.Black : Color.Red;\n    }\n\n    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}  And when used in our xaml:  LoginPage.xaml  ?xml version= 1.0  encoding= UTF-8 ?

But what if we accidentally provided a  string  to the  BoolToTextColorConverter :  Entry TextColor= {Binding Email, Converter={StaticResource boolToTextColorConverter}} /   This creates a runtime bug we won't discover until we build, deploy and navigate to the  LoginPage ; we'll see a type cast exception without a clear indication of the problem.

Unfortunately this attribute is in the  PresentationFramework  assembly, which we can't reference in a Xamarin.Forms PCL or shared project.  As the  ValueConversionAttribute  is simple in implementation, we can easily make our own:  [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class, AllowMultiple = true)]\npublic class ValueConversionAttribute : Attribute\n{\n  public ValueConversionAttribute(Type input, Type output)\n  {\n  }\n\n  public Type ParameterType { get; set; }\n}  Let's examine this attribute in detail:   The constructor  ValueConversionAttribute(Type input, Type output)  declares the expected input and output types for a converter.  Type input  is the expected  input  type for the value converter. This is the argument  object value  for the  Convert  method and the return type for the  ConvertBack  method.  Type output  is the expected  output  type for the value converter. This is the return type for the  Convert  method and the argument  object value  for the  ConvertBack  method.  The property  Type ParameterType  is the expected  paramter  type for the value converter. This is the argument  object parameter  for the  Convert  and  ConvertBack  methods.

Right click anywhere in your Xaml document and select \nRefactor\n -\n \nImplement View Model\n.\n\n\nMFractor will collect all the missing bindings and then generate a new class with \nall\n of those properties into a namespace named \nMyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels\n.\n\n\nDoes the view model already exist? Then MFractor simply inserts the missing bindings into the existing view model.\n\n\nI think it'll save you enough time during the week that you may just get to Friday beers a few hours early \ud83c\udf7b\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nBy right clicking anywhere in a Xaml document, implement all missing bindings as a new or into an existing view model:\n\n\nImplement view model properties with a getter and setter.\n\n\nImplement view model properties with a backing field.\n\n\nBound properties that return \nICommand\n will have an empty \nXamarin.Forms.Command\n instance generated.\n\n\nWhen MFractor encounters binding expressions that use a \nConverter\n, it inspects the converter for a \nValueConversion\n attribute to deduce the input typed required. If it can't resolve the converter or the converter does not have value conversion information, it will default to using \nSystem.Object\n.\n\n\nWhen implementing a new view model with getter and setters, MFractor will inspect for references to Fody's \nImplementPropertyChanged\n and annotate the new class with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Xaml Analysers:\n\n\nValidate that elements declared inside a resource dictionary have an x:Key.\n\n\nValidate that elements declared inside a resource dictionary have a unique x:Key value.\n\n\nDetect when an x:TypeArguments is used on a non-generic type and warn of incorrect usage.\n\n\nDetect when a property setter node (\nMyClass.MyProperty/\n) references a non-existent member on the parent class.\n\n\nDetect when a property setter attribute is empty.\n\n\nDetect when an undefined static resource is referenced by a \nStaticResource\n expression.\n\n\nDetect when the value returned by a \nStaticResource\n expression causes a type mismatch.\n\n\nDetect when an unknown type is being provided to a \nx:TypeArguments\n attribute.\n\n\nValidate that \nOnIdiom\n elements return the correct type for the outer property setter.\n\n\nValidate that \nOnPlatform\n elements return the correct type for the outer property setter.\n\n\nDetect when a developer has misused a property setter inside another xaml element.

Implement view model properties with a backing field.  Bound properties that return  ICommand  will have an empty  Xamarin.Forms.Command  instance generated.  When MFractor encounters binding expressions that use a  Converter , it inspects the converter for a  ValueConversion  attribute to deduce the input typed required. If it can't resolve the converter or the converter does not have value conversion information, it will default to using  System.Object .  When implementing a new view model with getter and setters, MFractor will inspect for references to Fody's  ImplementPropertyChanged  and annotate the new class with it.    New Xaml Analysers:  Validate that elements declared inside a resource dictionary have an x:Key.  Validate that elements declared inside a resource dictionary have a unique x:Key value.  Detect when an x:TypeArguments is used on a non-generic type and warn of incorrect usage.  Detect when a property setter node ( MyClass.MyProperty/ ) references a non-existent member on the parent class.  Detect when a property setter attribute is empty.  Detect when an undefined static resource is referenced by a  StaticResource  expression.  Detect when the value returned by a  StaticResource  expression causes a type mismatch.  Detect when an unknown type is being provided to a  x:TypeArguments  attribute.  Validate that  OnIdiom  elements return the correct type for the outer property setter.  Validate that  OnPlatform  elements return the correct type for the outer property setter.  Detect when a developer has misused a property setter inside another xaml element. For example,  OnIdiom.Phone  doesn't make any sense when wrapped by the outer element  OnPlatform .  Detect when an incorrect input type is provided to a  Converter . The value converter must have a  ValueConversion  attribute for this to trigger.  Detect when an incorrect output type is returned by a  Converter  expression. The value converter must have a  ValueConversion  attribute for this to trigger.  Detect when multiple occurrences of the same automation ID exists within a Xaml document.    New Xaml Fixes:  Generate missing resource dictionary keys.  Auto-correct misspelt  StaticResource  references.
