## Class Does Not Have Attached Property

Looks for attached properties (for example `Grid.Row`) and validates they exist in the class that they are attempting to use.

**Available Fixes**

 * [Replace with correct attached property name](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#replace-with-correct-attached-property-name)


## Code Behind Class Type Mismatch

Inspects the type defined by the root Xaml node and compares it against the base type of the code behind class to check for a type-mismatch.


## ContentPage Has Multiple Direct Children

Inspects usages of `ContentPage` and checks that it only has a single child view. Assigning multiple children into a `ContentPage` is a common mistake where the developer usually intended to wrap the chid views with a `Grid` or a `StackLayout`.

**Available Fixes**

 * [Encapsulate Content Page Children With StackLayout](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#encapsulate-content-page-children-with-stacklayout)


## ContentView Has Multiple Direct Children

Inspects usages of the `ContentView` element and checks that it only has a single child view. Assigning multiple children into a `ContentView` is a common mistake where the developer usually intended to wrap the chid views with a `Grid` or a `StackLayout`.


## Duplicate AutomationIds

Inspects a Xaml document for occurances of duplicate `AutomationId` declarations.


## Duplicate Code Behind Field Declarations

Checks that the value assigned to an `x:Name` attribute is unique within the scope of the document.


## Duplicate Namespace Declaration

Checks that an xml namespace points to a unique namespace and assembly. For example if both `xmlns:local="clr-namespace:MFractor.Licensing.MobileApp"` and `xmlns:myassembly="clr-namespace:MFractor.Licensing.MobileApp"` were declared, this analyser would warn that they both reference the same assembly and namespace.

**Available Fixes**

 * [Rename Duplicate Namespace References](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#rename-duplicate-namespace-references)


## Duplicate Resource Dictionary Keys

Validates the each resource entry within a resource dictionary has a unique key.


## Empty Code Behind Field Declaration

Inspects occurances of the `x:Name` attribute and validates that a value is assigned; empty `x:Name` expressions generate an empty named code-behind field, causing compilation errors.


## Event Handler Exists In Code Behind Class

Checks that an event callback referenced referenced by an attribute value exists in the code behind class.

**Available Fixes**

 * [Auto-Correct Event Handler Name](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#auto-correct-event-handler-name)

 * [Generate Event Handler](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#generate-event-handler)


## Event Handler Signature Mismatch

Checks that the signature for the event callback in a code behind class matches the expected signature for the property it is assigned to.


## Generic Usage Is Missing x:TypeArguments

Inspects generic classes that are instantiated through Xaml and validates that an `x:TypeArguments` attribute or property assignment node is present.

**Available Fixes**

 * [Create x:TypeArguments Attribute](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#create-x:typearguments-attribute)


## Inner Element Is Not Resource Dictionary

Inspects the inner element(s) of a `MyView.ResourceDictionary` property setter node  and checks that a resource dictionary is the inner element. It is common to forget to use a resource dictionary before adding resources

**Available Fixes**

 * [Encapsulate With Resource Dictionary](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#encapsulate-with-resource-dictionary)


## Missing Microsoft Schema

Inspects at the root xaml node and verifies that it references the Microsoft Xaml schema: `http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml`. This schema is required for Xamarin Forms Xaml documents.


## Obsolete Property Used

Checks for attributes that are marked as obsolete/deprecated.


## OnIdiom Return Type Mismatch

Checks the type returned by a `Xamarin.Forms.OnIdiom` element is valid with the parent property type.


## OnPlatform Return Type Mismatch

Checks the type returned by a `Xamarin.Forms.OnPlatform` element is valid with the parent property type.


## Property Node Maps To Member In Parent Type

Checks that a property node resolves to a member within its parent type.


## Property Setter Attribute Has Value

Checks that a value has been provided to an attribute property. This check is skipped if the property type is a string or a valueconverter or type converter is in use.


## Property Setter Node Has Value

Checks that a value has been provided to a node Property setter (EG `<MyClass.MyProperty></MyClass.MyProperty>`).


## Property Setter Node Misuse

Inspects for property setters that don't apply to the outer class. For example, if a developer used OnIdiom.Phone inside a OnPlatform element, the OnIdiom.Phone property setter makes no sense within the given context.


## Property Setter Type Mismatch

When using MyClass.MyProperty node setter syntax, validate that the inner child node returns a .NET object of the correct type for the property.


## Referenced Attribute Member Exists In Parent Type

Checks that an attribute resolves to a member within its parent type.

 * [Create Missing Property For Class](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#create-missing-property-for-class)

 * [Replace attribute with closely named member](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#replace-attribute-with-closely-named-member)


## Referenced Code Behind Field Exists

Inspects usages of the `x:Reference` expression and validates the referenced element has been declared within the document. `x:Reference` expressions are used to resolve another Xaml node has a code behind field defined using the `x:Name` attribute.

**Available Fixes**

 * [Replace x:Name with closely named member](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#replace-x:name-with-closely-named-member)


## Resource Entry Does Not Define Key

Validates the elements provided to a resource dictionary supply an `x:Key` attribute to declare their resource dictionary key.

**Available Fixes**

 * [Generate Resource Dictionary Key](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#generate-resource-dictionary-key)


## Root Element Defines Code Behind Class

Checks that the root xaml node defines a code behind class using the `x:Class` directive


## StaticResource Return Type Mismatch

Validates that the symbol returned by a `StaticResource` expression matches the expected type for the property.


## Undefined Static Resource Usage

Validates that the element referenced by a `StaticResource` expression resource lookup resolves to a resource defined in the xaml file.


## Unknown Static Property Value

For attributes that accept a class object, inspects that the literal value maps to a static property or field in the class type. For example, the `LayoutOptions` class has the static fields `Fill` or `CentreAndExpand` that can be used a literal attribute values. If `CentreAndFill` was provided (an invalid value), this analyser would inspect the `LayoutOptions` class for a static field named `CentreAndFill` and trigger an analysis error when it couldn't be found.

**Available Fixes**

 * [Replace unknown property value with autocorrection](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#replace-unknown-property-value-with-autocorrection)


## Unknown Type Provided To Generic

Inspects usages of `x:TypeArguments` and validates that the type provided exists.

**Available Fixes**

 * [Replace Field Or Method Reference With Property](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#replace-field-or-method-reference-with-property)


## Validate Value Types

Inspects the input provided to attributes that expect value types (int, bool, double etc) and validates that the input is valid.


## Value Converter Input Type Mismatch

Inspects the `Converter` property of a `Binding `expression and validates that the input type is correct. This analyser requires that the `IValueConverter` implementation uses the [`ValueConversion`](/xamarin-forms/value-converter-type-safety.md) attribute to declare it input type.


## Value Converter Output Type Mismatch

Inspects the `Converter` component of a `Binding` expression and validates that the returned output type is valid for the parent attribute. This analyser requires that the `IValueConverter` implementation uses the [`ValueConversion`](/xamarin-forms/value-converter-type-safety.md) attribute to declare it input type.


## x:Name Has Invalid Characters

Checks that x:Name expressions define a valid code-behind variable name. A value declared by an x:Name attribute must start with a @, _ or a-Z character followed by underscores or alpha-numeric characters.


## x:Static Return Type Mismatch

Validates that the .NET symbol returned by an `x:Static` expressions matches the expected type for the property.
