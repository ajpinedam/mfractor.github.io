This code analyser inspects usages of the `Grid.ColumnSpan` attribute and validates that the span provided is within the total columns declared by the parent grid.


## ContentPage Has Multiple Direct Children

Inspects usages of `ContentPage` and checks that it only has a single child view. Assigning multiple children into a `ContentPage` is a common mistake where the developer usually intended to wrap the chid views with a `Grid` or a `StackLayout`.

## Duplicate Code Behind Field Declarations

Checks that the value assigned to an `x:Name` attribute is unique within the scope of the document.


## Duplicate Namespace Declaration

Checks that an xml namespace points to a unique namespace and assembly. For example if both `xmlns:local="clr-namespace:MFractor.Licensing.MobileApp"` and `xmlns:myassembly="clr-namespace:MFractor.Licensing.MobileApp"` were declared, this analyser would warn that they both reference the same assembly and namespace.

 * [Rename Duplicate Namespace References](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#rename-duplicate-namespace-references)


## Duplicate Resource Dictionary Keys

Validates the each resource entry within a resource dictionary has a unique key.


## Empty Code Behind Field Declaration

Inspects occurances of the `x:Name` attribute and validates that a value is assigned; empty `x:Name` expressions generate an empty named code-behind field, causing compilation errors.


## Event Handler Exists In Code Behind Class

Checks that an event callback referenced referenced by an attribute value exists in the code behind class.

**Available Fixes**

 * [Auto-Correct Event Handler Name](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#auto-correct-event-handler-name)

**Available Fixes**

 * [Create x:TypeArguments Attribute](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#create-x:typearguments-attribute)


## Inner Element Is Not Resource Dictionary

Inspects the inner element(s) of a `MyView.ResourceDictionary` property setter node  and checks that a resource dictionary is the inner element. It is common to forget to use a resource dictionary before adding resources

**Available Fixes**

 * [Encapsulate With Resource Dictionary](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#encapsulate-with-resource-dictionary)


## Invalid Named Font Size

Inspects `FontSize` attributes and validates that the named size provided to it is a valid font size name (Micro, Small, Medium, Large).

**Available Fixes**

 * [Autocorrect Invalid FontSize](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#autocorrect-invalid-fontsize)


## Invalid Thickness Attribute Value

Inspects attribute properties that use the `Xamarin.Forms.Thickness` type and checks the value used can be translated to a thickness. For example, `Thickness` could accidentally be provided `0,5,05`, with the intention of it being `0,5,0,5`; the first example has three arguments while the second has four. This misuse would cause the app to crash when using inflated XAML or for XAMLC to fail.


## Missing Microsoft Schema

Inspects at the root xaml node and verifies that it references the Microsoft Xaml schema: `http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml`. This schema is required for Xamarin Forms Xaml documents.


## Obsolete Property Used

Checks for attributes that are marked as obsolete/deprecated.


## OnIdiom Return Type Mismatch

## Property Node Maps To Member In Parent Type

Checks that a property node resolves to a member within its parent type.


## Property Setter Attribute Has Value

Checks that a value has been provided to an attribute property. This check is skipped if the property type is a string or a valueconverter or type converter is in use.


## Property Setter Does Not Exist In Style TargetType

This code inspection looks at `Setter` elements when they are used inside a `Style` and validates that the member specified in the `Property` attribute exists on the type symbol referenced in the parent `Style`s `TargetType` attribute.

**Available Fixes**

 * [Replace Style Setter Property With Autocorrection](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#replace-style-setter-property-with-autocorrection)


## Property Setter Node Has Value

Checks that a value has been provided to a node Property setter (EG `<MyClass.MyProperty></MyClass.MyProperty>`).


## Property Setter Node Misuse

Inspects for property setters that don't apply to the outer class. For example, if a developer used OnIdiom.Phone inside a OnPlatform element, the OnIdiom.Phone property setter makes no sense within the given context.


## Property Setter Type Mismatch

When using MyClass.MyProperty node setter syntax, validate that the inner child node returns a .NET object of the correct type for the property.


## Referenced Attribute Member Exists In Parent Type

Checks that an attribute resolves to a member within its parent type.

 * [Create Missing Property For Class](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#create-missing-property-for-class)


## Referenced Code Behind Field Exists

Inspects usages of the `x:Reference` expression and validates the referenced element has been declared within the document. `x:Reference` expressions are used to resolve another Xaml node has a code behind field defined using the `x:Name` attribute.

**Available Fixes**

 * [Replace x:Name Reference With Autocorrection](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#replace-x:name-reference-with-autocorrection)


## Resource Entry Does Not Define Key

**Available Fixes**

 * [Generate Resource Dictionary Key](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#generate-resource-dictionary-key)


## Root Element Defines Code Behind Class

Checks that the root xaml node defines a code behind class using the `x:Class` directive


## Row Is Outside Grid Boundaries

This code analyser inspects usages of the `Grid.Row` attribute and validates that the row provided is within the total rows declared by the parent grid.


## RowSpan Is Outside Grid Boundaries

This code analyser inspects usages of the `Grid.RowSpan` attribute and validates that the span provided is within the total rows declared by the parent grid.


## ScrollView Has Multiple Direct Children

Inspects usages of `ScrollView` and checks that it only has a single child view. Assigning multiple children into a `ScrollView` is a common mistake where the developer usually intended to wrap the chid views with a `Grid` or a `StackLayout`.

**Available Fixes**

 * [Encapsulate Scroll View Children With Grid](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#encapsulate-scroll-view-children-with-grid)

## StaticResource Return Type Mismatch

Validates that the symbol returned by a `StaticResource` expression matches the expected type for the property.


## Style Is Missing TargetType

When a `Style` is used within XAML, it should always specify a type it targets using the `TargetType` property. This analysis check inspects for usages of `Style` that don't assign the `TargetType` property.

**Available Fixes**

 * [Add Missing Target Type Attribute](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#add-missing-target-type-attribute)


## Undefined Static Resource Usage

**Preview Feature**

Validates that the element referenced by a `StaticResource` expression resource lookup resolves to a resource defined in the xaml file.


## Unknown Static Property Value

For attributes that accept a class object, inspects that the literal value maps to a static property or field in the class type. For example, the `LayoutOptions` class has the static fields `Fill` or `CentreAndExpand` that can be used a literal attribute values. If `CentreAndFill` was provided (an invalid value), this analyser would inspect the `LayoutOptions` class for a static field named `CentreAndFill` and trigger an analysis error when it couldn't be found.

## Unknown Type Provided To Generic

Inspects usages of `x:TypeArguments` and validates that the type provided exists.

**Available Fixes**

 * [Replace Field Or Method Reference With Property](/code-actions/xaml/fix.md#replace-field-or-method-reference-with-property)


## Validate Value Types

Inspects the input provided to attributes that expect value types (int, bool, double etc) and validates that the input is valid.


## Value Converter Input Type Mismatch

Inspects the `Converter` property of a `Binding `expression and validates that the input type is correct. This analyser requires that the `IValueConverter` implementation uses the [`ValueConversion`](/xamarin-forms/value-converter-type-safety.md) attribute to declare it input type.


## Value Converter Output Type Mismatch

Inspects the `Converter` component of a `Binding` expression and validates that the returned output type is valid for the parent attribute. This analyser requires that the `IValueConverter` implementation uses the [`ValueConversion`](/xamarin-forms/value-converter-type-safety.md) attribute to declare it input type.
