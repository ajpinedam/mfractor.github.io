## Color Picker IntelliSense Code Action


![MFractor suggests all available colors and even lets you open a color picker to visually select a color.](/img/code-completion/xaml/color-intellisense.gif)

When editing a color in XAML, this code action opens the color picker, enabling you to visually choose the color you would like to use.


## Color Suggestions Completions


![MFractor suggests all available colors and even lets you open a color picker to visually select a color.](/img/code-completion/xaml/color-intellisense.gif)

Suggests available colors from the `Xamarin.Forms.Color` type. This is a significantly expanded choice of colors from the default XAML IntelliSense.


## ColumnDefinition Completion

When editing Grid.ColumnDefinitions this code completion inserts a ColumnDefinition with an automatically generated Width attribute.


## Event Completion

Suggests event handlers for XAML symbol.


## Generate Binding Context Command Completion


![When MFractor can infer your view model, you can generate commands onto your view model from IntelliSense.](/img/code-completion/xaml/generate-command-intellisense.gif)

When a binding context can be resolved at the current IntelliSense location and the user is editing a property that accepts an `ICommand`, this completion will generate a new command implementation onto the binding context and insert a `{Binding MyCommand}` expression in the XAML.


## Generate Effect Completion

When editing inside a `View.Effects` property setter node, this completion will generate a new `RoutingEffect` inside the shared code project and a `PlatformEffect` in iOS and Android projects.


## Generate Event Handler Completion

When the attribute at the current IntelliSense location is an event handler, this code completion will generate a new event handler in the code behind class for the XAML file.


## Generate Value Converter Resource Completion


![Use the Generate Value Converter IntelliSense action to create a new value converter from a resource dictionary.](/img/code-completion/xaml/generate-value-converter-intellisense.gif)

## Generate View Model Property Completion


![When MFractor can infer your view model, you can generate new properties your view model from IntelliSense.](/img/code-completion/xaml/generate-property-intellisense.gif)

When a binding context can be resolved at the current IntelliSense location and the user is editing a bindable property, this completion will generate a new property implementation (using any code snippet configuration) onto the binding context and insert a `{Binding MyProperty}` expression in the XAML.


## Gesture Recogiser Completion

When editing XAML files, MFractor will suggest the available types within a users solutions. For example, `View`s, `Trigger`s, `GestureRecognizer`s etc.

Using the image wizard developers can very quickly import new image resources into their iOS and Android apps, generating the downscaled image sizes and placing all image assets into the appropriate folders.


## Import Type Completion

When the XAML element can be resolved to a type in a namespace or assembly that isn't referenced by this XAML file, this completion lets you choose a new xml namespace name for it and create the xmlns import to resolve this symbol.


## Import Xml Namespace Completion


![MFractors import namespace completion takes the hard work out of writing new xml namespaces.](/img/code-completion/xaml/namespace-importing-intellisense.gif)

When creating a new xmlns declaration, this IntelliSense completion suggests all available namespaces and assemblies, creating the full xmlns statement to reference that namespace and assembly when actioned.


## Markup Extension Property Completion

## Markup Extension Type Completion

When editing XAML markup extension expressions, MFractor will suggest all available IMarkupExtensions based on the namespaces in the current XAML document.


## Rename Element Completion


![When you change the opening tag of XAML symbol, MFractor will automatically update it's closing tag and all its children!](/img/code-completion/xaml/rename-type-completion.gif)

When you change the opening tag of XAML symbol, MFractor will automatically update it's closing tag and all its children!


## Reserved Markup Extension Completion

When editing XAML markup extension expressions, MFractor will suggest all the common markup extension that are defined by the Xamarin.Forms and Microsoft schemas.

This includes the following markup extensions:

**Xamarin.Forms Markup Extensions**

 * **Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.ArrayExtension**: The Array markup extension allows you to define an array in markup
 * **Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.BindingExtension**: Creates a data-binding between this visual elements binding context and this bindable property.
 * **Xamarin.Forms.ConstraintExpression**: Defines a constraint relationship.
 * **Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.DynamicResourceExtension**: The DynamicResource markup extension is similar to the StaticResource markup extension in that both use a dictionary key to fetch a value from a ResourceDictionary. However, while the StaticResource performs a single dictionary lookup, the DynamicResource maintains a link to the dictionary key. Therefore, if the dictionary entry associated with the key is replaced, the change is applied to the visual element. This enables runtime style changes to be made in an application.
 * **Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.NullExtension**: A markup extension class that differentiates between null values and empty strings.
 * **Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.ReferenceExtension**: A markup extension for referring to other XAML-defined types.
 * **Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.StaticExtension**: A markup extension that gets a static member value.
 * **Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.StaticResourceExtension**: A markup extension that gets a static static resource value from this views resource dictionary, any referenced resource dictionaries or the App.xaml.
 * **Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.TemplateBindingExtension**: Binds a template property to the parent of the view that owns a ControlTemplate.
 * **Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.TypeExtension**: The Type markup extension is the XAML equivalent of the C# typeof keyword.
 * **Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.OnIdiomExtension**: A markup extension for applying idiom-specific values. [See here](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/pull/2615)
 * **Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.OnPlatformExtension**: A markup extension for applying platform-specific values. [See here](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/pull/2615)

**Microsoft Markup Extensions**

 * **x:Array**: The x:Array markup extension allows you to define an array in markup
 * **x:Binding**: Creates a data-binding between this visual elements binding context and this bindable property.
 * **x:DynamicResource**: The DynamicResource markup extension is similar to the StaticResource markup extension in that both use a dictionary key to fetch a value from a ResourceDictionary. However, while the StaticResource performs a single dictionary lookup, the DynamicResource maintains a link to the dictionary key. Therefore, if the dictionary entry associated with the key is replaced, the change is applied to the visual element. This enables runtime style changes to be made in an application.
 * **x:Null**: A markup extension class that differentiates between null values and empty strings.
 * **x:Reference**: A markup extension for referring to other XAML-defined types.
 * **x:Static**: A markup extension that gets a static member value.
 * **x:StaticResource**: A markup extension that gets a static static resource value from this views resource dictionary, any referenced resource dictionaries or the App.xaml.
 * **x:TemplateBinding**: Binds a template property to the parent of the view that owns a ControlTemplate.
 * **x:Type**: The x:Type markup extension is the XAML equivalent of the C# typeof keyword.

## RowDefinition Completion

When editing Grid.RowDefinitions this code completion inserts a RowDefinition with an automatically generated Height attribute.


## Select Image Asset Completion


![Use the select image completion to visually choose the image asset you'd like to use in your XAML.](/img/code-completion/xaml/select-image-completion.gif)

When editing the `Source` attribute for an `Image` view or any `Image` view subclass, this completion will open the image browser view so that you can visually choose the image you'd like to use.


## Setter Property Shorthand Completion


![When creating new styles, MFractor will suggest available properties for the control and then insert a full Setter for it!](/img/code-completion/xaml/setter-shorthand-intellisense.gif)

When editing inside a style and you wish to create a new Setter, MFractor will discover the outer target type for the style, trigger or visual state and suggest the properties that can be used inside a setter. When a setter property completion is triggered, MFractor inserts the setter as `<Setter Property="TheProperty" Value=""/>` and then centers the caret inside the value attribute.


## Static Resource Completion

Provides auto-completion support for Xamarin.Forms static resources defined in the current file, referenced resource dictionaries and the app.xaml.


## Trigger Completion


![MFractors Trigger Intellisense provides binding and target type completions and then makes it easy to apply your setter!](/img/code-completion/xaml/trigger-intellisense.gif)
