## XAML IntelliSense
*Autogenerated by MFractor v3.4.12*
## Attached Property Completions

Provides completion support for attached properties in XAML IntelliSense


## Binding Context Property Completion

When the binding context at the InteliSense location can be resolved, provides suggestions of available properties on that binding context. After choosing the binding context, MFractor inserts a `{Binding MyProperty}` expression into the XAML.


## Cascading Style Sheet Completions

Provides cascading style sheet resource suggestions into the XAML IntelliSense engine.


## Color Picker IntelliSense Code Action

When editing a color in XAML, this code action opens the color picker, enabling you to visually choose the color you would like to use.


## Color Suggestions Completions

Suggests available colors from the `Xamarin.Forms.Color` type. This is a significantly expanded choice of colors from the default XAML IntelliSense.


## Generate Binding Context Command Completion

When a binding context can be resolved at the current IntelliSense location and the user is editing a property that accepts an `ICommand`, this completion will generate a new command implementation onto the binding context and insert a `{Binding MyCommand}` expression in the XAML.


## Generate Effect Completion

When editing inside a `View.Effects` property setter node, this completion will generate a new `RoutingEffect` inside the shared code project and a `PlatformEffect` in iOS and Android projects.


## Generate Event Handler Completion

When the attribute at the current IntelliSense location is an event handler, this code completion will generate a new event handler in the code behind class for the XAML file.


## Generate View Model Property Completion

When a binding context can be resolved at the current IntelliSense location and the user is editing a bindable property, this completion will generate a new property implementation (using any code snippet configuration) onto the binding context and insert a `{Binding MyProperty}` expression in the XAML.


## Gesture Recogiser Completion

When editing XAML files, MFractor will suggest the available types within a users solutions. For example, `View`s, `Trigger`s, `GestureRecognizer`s etc.


## Trigger Completion

When editing XAML within a `View.Trigger` property assignment, MFractor suggests all available `Xamarin.Forms.Trigger`s within the namespaces in the current document. For example, `MultiTrigger`, `Trigger`, `DataTrigger` etc.


## Type Symbol Completion

When editing XAML files, MFractor will suggest the available types within a users solutions. For example, `View`s, `Trigger`s, `GestureRecognizer`s etc.
