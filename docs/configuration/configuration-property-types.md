## Code Snippet

Code snippets are source code samples that MFractor can use to generate arbitary code.

Code snippets are defined as C# code with named arguments (EG: `$name$`) that are replaced by the snippet engine when the code is being generated.

MFractor supports code snippets from 3 sources:

 - Users can define snippets inside Visual Studio Macs snippets editor and then reference them in an MFractor config through the `source="ide" value="snippet_name"` syntax.
 - Users can include snippets within their projects and then reference them in an MFractor config through the `source="file" value="Snippets/MySnippet.txt"` syntax.
 - Package and framework authors can silently inject desired code snippets by including them inside the `./build` folder of their package and targetting them in the `.mfx.xml` config file through the `value="Snippets/MySnippet.txt" syntax.



## Double




## Enum

When an enum value is encountered in a confg file, MFractor will try to parse the value into the properties enum type, falling back to the propeties default enum value.


## File Path

File Paths refer to files either absolutely or relative to the current project.


## String




## System.Boolean
