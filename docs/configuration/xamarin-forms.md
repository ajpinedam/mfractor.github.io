## Xamarin.Forms Feature Configuration
*Autogenerated by MFractor v3.2.19*
## MVVM Resolution Settings

**Configuration Id: com.mfractor.configuration.forms.mvvm_resolution**

The MVVM resolution settings can be used to specify the project that your views or view models sit within. If you prefer to separate your views and view models into separate projects, these settings enable MFractor to resolve the MVVM relationship across project boundaries.


### Configurable Properties
