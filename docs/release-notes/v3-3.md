##Release Notes - v3.3.0

**TO BE DECIDED**

## Introduction

This is a summary of the changes introduced in v3.3.0 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.

This standout feature in this release is the addition of code snippet support. Got a particular way you write your view model properties or commands? MFractor now lets you use your own code snippet, enabling complete customisation!

We've also added a localisation wizard that will quickly move string literals into ResX files, several handy code actions and a update notification dialog that let's you know when new MFractor releases are available.

## Features

 - A localisation Wizard for XAML and C#.
 - Code Snippet Support for view model properties, custom commands and bindable properties.
 - Use the *Extract XAML layout into new control* code action to move a XAML section into its own code file.
 - Use the *Generate Platform Effect* code action to easily generate the routing effect and platform effects.
 - Use the *Generate interface implementation* code action to quickly create a new class implementation from an existing C# interface;
 - The *Add `UsesLayout` to class code action* will append an `MFractor.Annotations.Android.UsesLayout` annotation to an Android class to specify the layout that class uses. Using this you can quickly enable MFractors Android layout usage validation.
 - Support for config files that are included within a nuget packages build folder. Framework authors can now include an MFractor config to enforce their framework standards by including a file named `.mfc.xml` in the packages build folder.

## Enhancements

 - Support for Visual Studio Mac 7.2.
 - Support for Roslyn 2.3.
 - MFractor now regularly checks for updates against the addin server and let's you know when there's been a new release.
 - Enhanced code completion for MFractor configuration files.
 - Specify a new width and height for the highest density image when you import an image with the image importing wizard.
 - Use the new Mvvm resolution configuration to specify the project in a solution that contains your views or view models. This lets MFractor resolve the MVVM relationship across project boundaries!
 - The `Generate constructor for all readonly members` will now include constructor arguments for auto properties as well as readonly fields.
 - The empty XAML attribute and node analysers have been removed as they were plain annoying (and frequently incorrect).
 - MFractor Lite now allows up to 5 pro feature uses per day.
 - Internally, MFractor now uses Roslyn's concept of text spans instead of line/columns. This reduces MFractors memory footprint and improves the speed of all analysers.
 - The following features are now professional only:
  - Image tooltips.
  - Go To View Model, Go To Code Behind and Go To View.
  - Android resource IntelliSense.
 - Code snippet support added for:
  - View Model Properties.
  - Bindable Properties.
  - Command Implementations.
  - Routing Effects.
  - Platform Specific Effects.
  - Value Converters.
  - Value Conversion Attribute.
  - Code Behind class declarations.

## Bug Fixes

 - Fixed: MFractor no longer bundles the Microsoft.CodeAnalysis (Roslyn) assemblies into its distribution package. This caused critical issues in VSMac 7.2.
 - Fixed: Upgraded MFractor to use Microsoft.CodeAnalysis (Roslyn) 2.3. This required several code generators to be upgraded.
 - Fixed: A regression in the *Migrate OnPlatform* code action caused it to failed.

## Deprecations

 - The configurable property `ImplementConversionForConvert` on the value converter generator is deprecated and has been removed. Please use the code snippet to control the `Convert` method body.
 - The configurable property `ImplementConversionForConvertBack` on the value converter generator is deprecated and has been removed. Please use the code snippet to control the `ConvertBack` method body.
