##Release Notes - v3.3.0

**TO BE DECIDED**

##Introduction

This is a summary of the changes introduced in v3.3.0 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.

This release focuses on adding killer tools for working with images. We've added an import image wizard to make it dead-simple to bring images into your Android, iOS and Xamarin.Forms apps. You can access the image wizard through the **Tools** main menu and then selecting **Import Image Wizard**.
