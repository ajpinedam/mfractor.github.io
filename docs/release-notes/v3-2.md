##Introduction

This is a summary of the changes introduced in v3.2.0 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.

This release focuses on adding killer tools for image and localisation support. We've added an import image wizard to make it dead-simple to bring images into your Android, iOS and Xamarin.Forms apps. Additionally, we've added a page localisation wizard that makes localising entire XAML pages extremely straightforward.

We've also added lots of

## Lite Features

 - XAML Code Actions:
 - Grid Analysis Support:
    - Check that value used in `Grid.RowSpan` usages don't extend beyond the amount of rows declared by the grid.
    - Check that value used in `Grid.ColumnSpan` usages don't extend beyond the amount of columns declared by the grid.
 - Command Parameter Analysis Support:
 - ScrollView Analysis Support:


## Professional Features

 - Use the new Import Image Wizard to import Android, iOS and Xamarin.Forms images into your app painlessly.
 - Use the localisation wizard to replace strings in your XAML with a localised lookup.

## Enhancements

 - The C# code diagnostic that inspected usages of `ExportRendererAttribute` has been disabled. It was causing false warnings.
 - Significantly reduced XAML analysis time through aggressive caching strategies in each analysis pass. This slightly increases MFractors memory overhead.

## Bug Fixes

 - Fixed: When a folder path is used in a config file for a new code file, MFractor will now create that folder when it's missing instead of silently failing.
