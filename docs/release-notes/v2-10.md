##Introduction

This is a summary of the changes introduced in v2.10.2 of MFractor for Xamarin Studio.

This release is all about improving MFractors usability. You can now tap Alt+Return in Xaml documents to quickly access any fixes or refactorings at that location, the xaml analyser has been tuned for speed and a new code issue tooltip gives deeper insight into the code issue beneath it:

##Features

   - The quick fix menu is now available to quickly access all Xaml actions. Tap Alt+Return in your Xaml document for a list of available code actions to appear!
   - The xaml analyser integration has been rebuilt and as such, xaml analysis is now much, much quicker. You might notice that fixable issues no longer underline in yellow; the check for available fixes is now
   - An improved code issue tooltip now appears when you hover over a xaml or android resource. This tooltip tells you what kind of error it is (Compile time, runtime or code improvement), presents information on the issue and let's you know if any fixes are available.

##Enhancements

 - Improve the can execute checking algorithms for all code actions (refactorings, issue fixes etc) to reduce the noise in the quick fix menu.

##Bug Fixes

 - Fixed: When generating a view model and the view has bindings against an unknown class, previously these bindings would be missed.
