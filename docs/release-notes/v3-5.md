## Release Notes v3.5.0

**TO BE DECIDED**

## Introduction

This is a summary of the changes introduced in v3.5.0 of MFractor for Visual Studio Mac.

This release focuses on stabilising what MFractor already has and enhancing all of our existing features.

For example, we've added a dozen more code completions, significantly improved our XAML tooltips, added some preliminary tools for

## Features

 * The Go To Implementation C# code action will find interface and abstract class implementations for a given type or member. Use this with the `Option+D` shortcut.
 * Use the **Clean And Compress** action to clean and then zip up a project or solution.
 * XAML IntelliSense:
   * Suggest available value converters in resource dictionaries.
   * Suggest a variety of commonly used types inside resource dictionaries.
   * Use the Generate Effect IntelliSense code action to quickly create a new platform specific effect.
   * When setting the row or column of an element in a grid, MFractor will suggest available row and column indexes with a summary of that row/column.
 * Code Actions:
   * The Generate XAML Localisation infrastructure code action will create the necessary classes to localise XAML.
   *  
 * Code Analysis:
 * Localisation Tooling:
   *
 * Use the iOS App Icon Wizard to
 * Tooltips:
   * Fonts:
   * Automation ids:
   * Colors:
   * Localisation values when using a translate extension and resx files:
   * When you hover over a grid row or column definition, you can now see the index that row or column.

## Enhancements

 * Support for "invisible" config files. Name a config file .mfc.xml and place it alongside a project for MFractor to import that config setting. Silent configs are designed to be included in a .gitignore so you can use MFractor configs without needing to include it into your project.
 * In IntelliSense, MFractor can now infer the binding context from the current context while you're editing your XAML. For example:
    * Support for inferring the binding context via ListView's item source while editing inside the ItemTemplate.
    * Support for custom binding contexts using the `<MyXamlPage.BindingContext>< local:MyViewModel> </MyXamlPage.BindingContext>` syntax.
    * Support for custom binding contexts through the `BindingContext` attribute. EG `<... BindingContext="{x:Type local:MyViewModel}"/>` or `<... BindingContext="{x:Reference slider}"/>`.
 * MFractor can now discover the view model for your XAML across project boundaries. For example, if your views are defined in `MyApp.Views` and your view models are defined in `MyApp.ViewModels`, when one of these project references the other, MFractor will discover the MVVM relationship and use it to power the MVVM tool-suite.
 * MFractor now let's you know that your license is expiring and directs you to re-purchase (1 week before expiry, day of expiry)
 * Significantly improved support for generating code across project boundaries.
 * When MFractor detects multiple code issues at the same location, it will display errors first, then warnings and lastly all other issues.
 * Cleaned up error messages for code analysis issues to make the issues they find more precise.

## Bug Fixes

 * Fixed: Added parser support for `using:` syntax inside XAML namespace declarations.
 * Fixed: When converting fully qualified types into usings, the syntax reducer would collapse namespace declaration and other using statements.
 * Fixed: The syntax reducer would occasionally make the generate immutable constructor and the generate base class constructor code action fail.
 * Fixed: Don't suggest the exact same namespace for a symbol in XAML when it can't be resolved.
 * Fixed: When an assembly isn't referenced by a project, describe it clearly in the missing assembly xmlns code issue.
 * Fixed: When a symbol can't be resolved because it's namespace is unresolved, clearly say this in the code analysis issue.
 * Fixed: MFractor now supports creating custom controls or classes into other assemblies as specified by the xml namespace.
 * Fixed: When the root element in a XAML document failed to resolve it would cause a cascading effect that broke subsequent symbol resolutions and caused false code issues to be reported.
 * Fixed: For attached properties on the root XAML node, correctly resolve the symbol when the root element fails to resolve.
 * Fixed: When using go to view model or code behind and the view model or code behind is already open, MFractor will focus the document and not jump to the symbol.
 * Fixed: When navigating to a XAML symbol that has a XAML file as UI code, MFractor now opens the XAML file instead of the code behind.
