##Welcome

Hey there fellow Xamarin developer!

Welcome to the documentation for MFractor, the essential productivity tool for Xamarin Studio.

Have you ever...

 * Hit runtime issues so obvious you were scratching your head over why code analysis didn't pick it up?
 * Been frustrated by continuously writing the same boilerplate code?
 * Felt you're doing a LOT of text searching when a class **should** just be a keystroke away?

As a seasoned Xamarin developer, these problems bit me many times over the years... And they irked me so much that I started building MFractor to solve these issues.

MFractor gives you several features so you can make great apps faster:

 * A comprehensive code analyser turns runtime crashes into in-editor code warnings.
 * A code generation engine auto-magically creates boilerplate code in a few clicks instead of a few hundred keystrokes.
 * A few dozen of navigation improvements remove the friction of navigating your apps source code.

Slowly, I am building the ReSharper for Xamarin Studio and I'm thrilled that you have joined me on the journey.

If something doesn't work quite right or you'd like a sweet new feature added, be patient and contact me:

 * Via Twitter: Give me a holla at [@matthewrdev](https://twitter.com/matthewrdev)
 * Via Slack: Drop in to chat anytime in the [#mfractor Xamarin Slack sub-channel](https://xamarinchat.slack.com/archives/mfractor).
 * Via Email: Shot an email to hello@mfractor.com

Finally, thank you for installing and using MFractor. It means the world to me.
