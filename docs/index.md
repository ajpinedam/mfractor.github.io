##Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for MFractor, incredible Xamarin tools.

MFractor adds several features so you can make great Xamarin.Forms apps faster:

 * Spend less time debugging with a comprehensive xaml analyser.
 * Write great code faster with Xaml refactoring and code generation.
 * Quickly explore Xamarin.Forms projects with rich xaml navigation.
 * ... And much, much more!

Slowly, I am building the ReSharper for Xamarin Studio and I'm thrilled that you have joined me on the journey.

To get started, checkout:

 * [The Xamarin.Forms Quickstart Guide](xamarin-forms-quickstart.md)
 * [The Xamarin.Android Quickstart Guide](xamarin-android-quickstart.md)

If something doesn't work quite right or you'd like a sweet new feature added, be patient and contact me:

 * Via Twitter: Give me a holla at [@matthewrdev](https://twitter.com/matthewrdev)
 * Via Slack: Drop in to chat anytime in the [#mfractor Xamarin Slack sub-channel](https://xamarinchat.slack.com/archives/mfractor).

Finally, thank you for installing and using MFractor. It means the world to me.
