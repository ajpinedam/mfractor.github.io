##Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for MFractor, incredible Xamarin tools.

MFractor adds several features so you can make great Xamarin.Forms apps faster:

 * A xaml analyser turns runtime crashes into in-editor code warnings.
 * A code generation engine auto-magically creates boilerplate code in a few clicks instead of a few hundred keystrokes.
 * Several navigation improvements remove the friction of navigating your apps source code.

Slowly, I am building the ReSharper for Xamarin Studio and I'm thrilled that you have joined me on the journey.

To get started, checkout:

 * [The Xamarin.Forms Quickstart Guide](xamarin-forms-quickstart.md)
 * [The Xamarin.Android Quickstart Guide](xamarin-android-quickstart.md)

If something doesn't work quite right or you'd like a sweet new feature added, be patient and contact me:

 * Via Twitter: Give me a holla at [@matthewrdev](https://twitter.com/matthewrdev)
 * Via Slack: Drop in to chat anytime in the [#mfractor Xamarin Slack sub-channel](https://xamarinchat.slack.com/archives/mfractor).
 * Via Email: Shot an email to hello@mfractor.com

Finally, thank you for installing and using MFractor. It means the world to me.
