##Implementing View Models

*Generate properties and view models from Xaml to C# using code fixes and the Implement View Model refactoring*

##Introduction

In Xamarin.Forms apps, we design our applications using the Model - View - ViewModel design pattern; relying on binding mechanisms to mirror data back and forth between the view and view model.

We accomplish this data-transfer behaviour through the [Binding Markup Extension](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/Xamarin.Forms.Binding/). This is a Xamarin.Forms API that implements the [IMarkupExtension interface](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.IMarkupExtension/); it reflects changes from the binding context to the view and vice-versa.

We use the binding markup extension syntax in our Xaml views:

**LoginPage.xaml.cs**
```
<Entry Text="{Binding Username}"/>
```

**LoginViewModel.cs**
```
public class LoginViewModel
{
  public string Username { get; set; }
}
```

In the above example, `{Binding Username}` points to a public property on the `LogingPage`s binding context, the `LoginViewModel`. When the user enters text, changes are automatically applied into the `Username` property.

But what if we introduced a new `Entry` bound to `Password`, a property that doesn't exist on the `LoginViewModel`:

**LoginPage.xaml.cs**
```
<Entry Text="{Binding Username}"/>
<Entry Text="{Binding Password}"/>
```

Provided we have configured the views binding context correctly, the [Xaml analyser](/xamarin-forms/analysis.md) recognises this is a runtime bug and marks it:

MFractor encourages a **Xaml first** workflow; you write out bindings in Xaml and then generate the implementation on the view model.

This is a big change to existing workflows. Previously, we coded these properties by hand and wire them up manually in the Xaml; an approach both time-consuming and error prone. You have to remember property names, property types, control types and then you need to write this all out by hand!

Using binding generation we can *literally* eliminate minutes of work and hundreds of keystrokes in a few clicks.

MFractor provides the following shortcuts to implement our bound properties:

 * [Fix Missing Binding](#issues-fixing-on-missing-bindings): A code issue fix that generates a single binding property onto the view model.
 * [Implement View Model](#the-implement-viewmodel-refactoring): A refactoring action that collects *all* missing bindings and generates them in bulk on the view model.

Let's examine these two methods of implementing missing properties using MFractor.

##Issue Fixing on Missing Bindings
When MFractor detects that a property in a binding expression doesn't exist on the binding context, it adds a code issue at the missing bindings location.

To action the code isxue fix, we right click on the issue (underlined in yellow), navigate to **Fix** and then select **Generate a property...**.

We have two options available when generating a property:

**Generate a property named XXX in XXX** creates a new public property with a public `get` and `set` accessor:

```
public string Password { get; set; }
```

**Generate a property named XXX in XXX with backing fields** creates a new public property with a public `get` and `set` accessor that sets or gets a backing field:

```
private string _password;
public string Password
{
  get
  {
    return _password;
  }
  set
  {
    _password = value;
  }
}
```

The default getter / setter fix is most useful when:

 * We want a plain old property with no backing logic.
 * We are using Fody's [ImplementPropertyChanged](https://github.com/Fody/PropertyChanged) attribute on our ViewModel to automatically add INotifyPropertyChanged behaviour.

The backing field fix is most useful when:

 * We want backing logic that occurs when our property changes.
 * We occasionally want to manipulate the properties backing field without changes propagating to the UI.

##The Implement ViewModel Refactoring
Another way to generate properties for a view model is to use the **Implement View Model** refactoring. This shortcut collects *all* missing binding expressions (excluding bindings inside DataTemplates) and generates them in bulk onto the binding context.

We can access this short cut by right clicking anywhere in a Xaml file, navigating to **Refactor** and then selecting the **Implement View Model** action:

![](/img/tutorials/implementing-view-models/implement-view-model.gif)

You'll notice that there are 2 actions:

 * **Implement View Model** gathers all missing bindings in the xaml document and implements them all as public properties with a public `get` and `set` accessor.
 * **Implement View Model (Use Backing Fields)** gathers all missing bindings in the xaml document and implements them all as public properties with a public `get` and `set` accessor that sets or gets a backing field.

There are often cases when a binding context isn't specified [explicitly ](/xamarin-forms/configure-binding-context.md#explicit-binding-context-resolution) and can't be inferred [implicitly](/xamarin-forms/configure-binding-context.md#implicit-binding-context-resolution). A common example of this is that you have just started to build a Xaml view and haven't yet got around to building the corresponding view model.

The **Implement View Model** action can also generate a view model class for the Xaml view if one is not already defined. Using Mvvm naming conventions, MFractor generates a view model class for your xaml view under the `MyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels` namespace.

For example:

**LoginPage.xaml.cs**
```
<Entry Text="{Binding Username}"/>
<Entry Text="{Binding Password}"/>
```

When creating the view model class, MFractor removes the *Page* or *View* suffix from the view name and then attaches *ViewModel* to the end of the resulting name.

 * 1. Remove the *Page* or *View* suffix: LoginPage -> Login
 * 2. Attach the *ViewModel* suffix: Login -> LoginViewModel
 * 3. Generate a new class named `LoginViewModel` under the namespace `MyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels`.

This would result in the following view model class file:

**LoginViewModel.cs**
```
public namespace MyDefaultNamespace.ViewModels
{
  public class LoginViewModel
  {
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public string Password { get; set; }
  }
}
```

If you project references Fody's [ImplementPropertyChanged](https://github.com/Fody/PropertyChanged) extension, the default getter / setter implementation will also annotate the result with the `[ImplementPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged]` attribute:

**LoginViewModel.cs**
```
[ImplementPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged]
public class LoginViewModel
{
}
```

##Generating Commands Implementations
When MFractor encounters a property that expects the `System.Windows.Input.ICommand` interface, it will generate a property returning a empty command implementation.

For example, we bind our login button to a `LoginCommand` property on our view model:

```
<Button Command="{Binding LoginCommand}"/>
```

When MFractor generates the property for `LoginCommand`, it creates an empty command implementation:

```
public System.Windows.Input.ICommand LoginCommand
{
    get
    {
        return new Xamarin.Forms.Command(() =>
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }

        );
    }
}
```

##Binding Generation And Value Converters

When a binding expression uses a `Converter`, MFractor will attempt to resolve the input type of the referenced value converter and use that as the property type. We must have a value conversion attribute on the `IValueConverter` for MFractor to resolve the input type. Please read the [Value Conversion Type-Safety](/tutorials/xamarin-forms/value-converter-type-safety.md) tutorial to learn more.

For example, we add a login button that is only enabled when the user has their password entered:

```
<ResourceDictionary>
	<local:StringToBoolConverter x:Key="stringToBoolConverter" />
</ResourceDictionary>

<Button IsEnabled="{Binding Password, Converter={StaticResource stringToBoolConverter}}"/>
```

Provided that `stringToBoolConverter` is annotated to accept string inputs and return a boolean output, MFractor can still generate `Password` as a string even though `IsEnabled` is a boolean property.

If there is no value conversion information on the value converter, MFractor will default to `Systen.Object` as the type for our property:

```
public System.Object Password
{
  get; set;
}
```

##Limitations
There are a some limitations in the **Implement View Model** refactoring:

* When a Xaml view has an item that uses a `DataTemplate` to declare an inline view, MFractor *will not* gather the bindings inside the data template. A refactoring action to generate bindings for data templates will be coming in a future MFractor release.

##Summary
By building our apps using the **Xaml first** mindset, we can leverage MFractor's binding generation to implement our view models quickly.

In this tutorial we learnt:

 * We can generate entire view models using the **Implement View Model** refactoring action.
 * We can generate single properties using code issue fixing.
 * We need a binding context to activate binding expression analysis and issue fixing.
 * When a binding uses a value converter, MFractor use the correct type when the converter has a value conversion attribute.
