*Installing, activating and updating MFractor*

##Introduction
This document covers how to install, activate and update MFractor for Xamarin Studio.

##Install MFractor
The simplest way to install MFractor into Xamarin Studio is by using the MFractor.Installer helper addin.

This addin lives inside the Addin Manager in Xamarin Studio, under **Gallery** -> **IDE extensions**.

Open up Xamarin Studio and click on the **Xamarin Studio** then **Addins...**

Once the Addin Manager opens, click **Gallery** and under **IDE extensions** locate **MFractor.Installer**. If this isn't present, hit the **Refresh** button to update the Gallery listings.

Next we need to activate MFractor.

##Activation

After installing MFractor, you'll need activate it using your email address.

First things first, **close the Addin Manager**. There is a known bug that blocks the email entry field from receiving keyboard when the Addin Manager is open. It's a pain and we are working on fixing this.

To activate MFractor, enter you email and then click **Activate**.

##Updating
MFractor will receive regular updates adding sweet new features and bug fixes so it's important to keep up to date!

When MFractor installs into Xamarin Studio, it'll register itself into Xamarin Studios addin updater.

This means that Xamarin Studio **should** automatically prompt you that an update is available.

However, you can check for udpate at any time by opening the **Xamarin Studio** main menu and selecting **Check for Updates...**

Xamarin Studio will check the MFractor addin server for updates and prompt you to update if there is a new version!

##Uninstalling MFractor
You can uninstall MFractor through the addin manager at any time. We'll be sad to see you go!

Select the **Xamarin Studio** main menu and then **Addins**

Under **Gallery** then **IDE extensions** select the MFractor addin list item and then click **Uninstall**

You will be prompted to uninstall the addin, confirm uninstallation by clicking **Uninstall**
