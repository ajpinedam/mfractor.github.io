**A centralised location to easily manage the image assets in your mobile solution**

## Introduction

The image asset manager summarises all image assets across your solution from your iOS and Android projects.

As a developer, you gain a birds-eye view of all image assets in your solution and that then allows you to delete, import, search and optimise all images from a centralised location.
