**A centralised location to easily manage the image assets in your mobile solution**

## Introduction

The image asset manager summarises all image assets across your solution from your iOS and Android projects.

As a developer, you gain a birds-eye view of all image assets in your solution and that then allows you to delete, import, search and optimise all images from a centralised location.

## Drag And Drop

The image manager supports drag and drop from the image asset list onto a code file.

When you drag and drop an image onto a code file, the image manager will generate code to access that image.

For example, given the image `logo.png`, MFractor will insert the following code:

 * **Android AXML**: `@drawable/logo`.
 * **Android C#**: `Resource.Drawable.logo`.
 * **XAML**: `logo`.
 * **C# (Xamarin.Forms)**: `"logo.png"`;
