Tada! You are now ready to rock.

## Importing An MFractor Professional License

Download and locate your license file (which ends with the extension `.lic`). When purchasing MFractor Professional, this license file will be provided in an email. In this example, our license file is located on our desktop called `license.lic`.

Open Visual Studio for Mac. If you have not activated MFractor with an email address, close the activation window.

Voila, you now have a valid, active MFractor Professional installation.

**It is safe to delete the license file from its original location. MFractor stores the license inside itself.**
