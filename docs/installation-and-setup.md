**Installing, activating and updating MFractor.**

## Introduction

This

## Visual Studio Mac

## Visual Studio Windows
Open Visual Studio

In the activation dialog, enter your email and name and then click **Activate**.

Download and locate your license file (which ends with the extension .lic). When purchasing MFractor Professional, this license file will be provided in an email. In this example, our license file is located on our desktop called license.lic.

Open Visual Studio for Mac. If you have not activated MFractor with an email address, close the activation window.

In the main Visual Studio for Mac menu bar, select MFractor and then Licensing. This will open the licensing window where you can import or remove an MFractor Professional license.

Next, click on the Import License button, browse to the license file (license.lic) and double click it to import the license into MFractor.

It is safe to delete the license file from its original location. MFractor stores the license inside itself.

The licensing window will list:

* Licensed To - The full name of the person that the MFractor Professional license is issued to.
* License Email: - The email that this MFractor Professional license is issued against.
* License Type and Expiry Date - The type of license issued (Professional, Trial or Lite) and when that license expires.

## Deactivating Your Professional License
If you'd like to remove a license from MFractor, you can open the MFractor license information window and click Remove License.

**This is a destructive operation, you cannot undo removing a license but you can re-import a new license.**

After removing a license, you will be automatically downgraded to a free MFractor license. This allows usage of most features apart from C# code actions, mobile-specific C# code diagnostics, and configuration file support.

If you are using MFractor for Visual Studio Windows, you will be unable to use any MFractor features.
