#Resource IntelliSense

*Building Android resource files such as values, menus, drawables or layouts using resource code completion*

## Introduction

As a Xamarin.Android developer, chances are you will spend a significant amount of time building application resources like values, drawables, menus and layouts (plus more!) within the `Resources/` directory of your project.

MFractor improves this experience by adding comprehensive Resource IntelliSense; autocompletion for most resource types (all but layouts) within a Xamarin.Android project.
