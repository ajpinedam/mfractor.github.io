*Changing the behavior of MFractor's code generation and code actions*

## Introduction

The configuration engine allows customization of MFractor to generate code specific to your project. Initially, the amount of options that are exposed will be limited but over time I will drastically increase the flexibility of MFractors code generation engine.

If you wish to have a piece of code generation customizable, please submit a feature request at [MFractor Feedback](https://github.com/mfractor/mfractor-feedback/issues/new).

## Configuration Basics

Conceptually, MFractor has *Configurables*, extensible features that expose properties that can be edited by a configuration file. *Configurables* can be C# code actions, XML analysers, XAML code generators and much more.

When browsing this website, you may notice that parts of the site are tagged as *Autogenerated*. Several parts of this documentation site are autogenerated from the configurable features inside MFractor, grouping them by behaviour and categories.

Let's look at the 3 main configurable feature types:

###C ode Actions

Code actions are features exposed through the IDE context menu (accessed via `Right CLick` or `Alt+Return`) that fix code issues and organise, refactor and generate source code.

### Code Analysis

Code analysis features are linters that inspect for problems in your source code. Typically, code analysers are *not* configurable.

### Code Generation

Code generators create source code (such as C# or XAML); they isolate the creation of a common piece of code into a single, reusable unit.

Code generators are only ever directly used by code actions; they are not exposed through the IDE.

## Configuration Files

MFractor configuration files are XML based and end with the extension `.mfc.xml`; a configuration file can be named anything and be placed in any directory if a project as long as it ends in the extension `.mfc.xml`.

How does it work? Let's consider the following configuration file:

**config.mfc.xml**

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<mfractor>
		<!-- Change the behaviour of the Implement View Model code action -->
    <configure id="com.mfractor.code_actions.xaml.implement_view_model">
            <property name="BaseClass" value="MyNamespace.ViewModels.ViewModelBase"/>
    </configure>
</mfractor>
```

Let's examine each of the each element in the above configuration in depth:

   - We open a configuration file with the `<mfractor>` tag; this is ceremony to denote to MFractor this is a config file.
   - We **target** a configurable by using the `<configure>` element:
    - The `id` attribute specifies the unique identifier of the configurable we wish to modify. An id could refer a code action, a code generator or an analysis routine.
   - We **modify** a property using the `<property>` element:
    - The `name` attribute specifies the configurable property we wish to edit.
    - The `value` attribute specifies the value we wish to set the property to.
    - We **group** configurations within the `<collection name="CollectionName">` element. These groups are hard coded into the product itself and relate to how the code actions, code generation and code analysis documentation folders are structured in this site.

## Configuration Identifiers

Every element inside MFractor that can be configured has it's own unique **configuration identifier**. This a java-style, package based string that indicates the software, element type and element name inside the name.

For example, the Xamarin.Forms [Implement View Model](/code-actions/xaml/generate.md#implement-view-model) code action has the configuration identifier `com.mfractor.code_actions.xaml.implement_view_model`. A features id is located below the heading inside the documentation:

![Location of configuration identifier](/img/configuration/config-id.png)

If we wanted to change the behaviour of the *Implement View Model* code action, we add a `configure` element into our `.mfc.xml` and target the identifier `com.mfractor.code_actions.xaml.implement_view_model`:

```
<configure id="com.mfractor.code_actions.xaml.implement_view_model">
</configure>
```

Inside the `configure` element we can now specify multiple `property` tags to change properties inside the configurable.

## Configurable Properties

After targeting a configurable, we can use **Configurable Properties** to change the behaviour of that feature.

Configurable properties are settings that can be edited on a configurable through the use of the `property` tag.

We place a `property` tag inside a `configure` tag; we can then target the property name using the `name` attribute and apply a new value using the `value` attribute.

For example, we can change the output folder for new ViewModels by using a `property` setter on the `ViewModelsFolder` property:

```
<configure id="com.mfractor.code_actions.xaml.implement_view_model">
	<property name="ViewModelsFolder" value="Path/To/ViewModelsFolder"/>
</configure>
```

## Code Generation Dependencies

Often multiple code actions need to generate the same source; rather than configuring each code action separately each code action reuses a common **code generator**. A code generator is a configurable that encapsulates the logic needed to generate a specific piece of code.

For example, both the [Implement View Model](/code-actions/xaml/generate/#implement-view-model) and [Generate Missing Command](/code-actions/xaml/fix/#generate-missing-binding-command-stub) use the [Generate ICommand Implementation](/code-generation/xamarin-forms/#generate-icommand-implementation) code generator; this allows us to set the `ICommand` type once and have the behaviour propagate through all code-actions that need to generate an ICommand implementation.

This documentation site lists the code-generaton dependencies under the **Uses:** section.
