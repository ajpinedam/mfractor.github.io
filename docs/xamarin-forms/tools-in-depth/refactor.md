##Refactoring
*(Autogenerated by MFractor v2.10.0.0)*
All available refactorings in MFractor for Xamarin.Forms

*3 Code Actions*
##Edit Inline Color

This action let's you select any attribute that expects a `Xamarin.Forms.Color` and let's you edit it using a color editor dialog.

##Extract Attribute Value Into Property Binding

When a Xaml attribute is initialised by a literal value (rather than an expression), this refactoring action allows a developer to extract that literal value as a property into the binding context and replace the attribute initialiser with a binding expression.

For example, given the attribute initialiser `Text="Hello Xamarin.Forms!"`, this refactoring would generate a user named property (EG: Message) in the binding context, initiliase it with the string literal `"Message"` and replace the attribute value with the binding expresion `{Binding Message}`.
