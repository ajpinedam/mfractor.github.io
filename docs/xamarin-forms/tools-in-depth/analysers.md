##Xamarin.Forms Xaml Analysis
*A complete list of all Xaml analysers in MFractor for Xamarin.Forms - 41 analysers*

*(Autogenerated by MFractor v2.7.0.0)*
## Attribute Maps To Member In Parent Type
Checks that an attribute resolves to a member within its parent type.

**Available Fixes**

 * **Generate property onto parent type**: This fix generates a property with a getter and setter onto the parent type.
 * **Generate bindable property on type**: This fix generates a bindable property onto the targetted .
 * **Replace attribute with closely named member**: Looks for members on a C# class that are named closely to an unresolved xml attribute and then suggest near matches.

## Binding Expressions Resolve
Inspects binding expressions and validates that the symbol referred to in the binding context exists. This analyser requires an explict or implicit binding context to be present for the document.

**Available Fixes**

 * **Autocorrect property | Generate property**: When the symbol referenced inside a binding expression is unresolved, this fix can either apply an auto-correcet or generate a property on elements the BindingContext

## Check C# symbosl inside xaml expressions resolve
Inspects a .net symbol reference (eg local:MyClass.MyProperty) and validates that the symbol portion ('MyClass.MyProerty') resolves to a .NET symbol within the current project and it's references.

**Available Fixes**

 * **Autocorrect class or property**: When a c# symbol reference expression does not resolve, this fix applies an auto-corrected suggestion from the class/property.
 * **Generate class and static member**: When a c# symbol reference expression does not resolve, this fix generates a stub class declaration with a default, readonly static member.
 * **Generate class**: When a c# symbol reference expression does not resolve, this fix generates an implementation for the missing class.
 * **Generate property**: Generate a static or constant variable onto the targetted class

## Check namespaces inside xaml expressions resolve
Inspects a .net symbol reference (eg local:MyClass.MyProperty) and validates that the namespace portion ('local') resolves to a xmlns declaration in the current document.

**Available Fixes**

 * **Import namespace and assembly**: When the namespace inside c# symbol reference expression can be resolved to a .NET symbol in the project or its references this fix generates an 'xmlns' import statement in the root xaml element.

## Check Root Element Defines Code Behind Class
Checks that the root xaml node defines a code behind class using the 'x:Class' directive

## Check Xaml Nodes Is Not Abstract
Checks that an xml node resolves to a non-abstract, concrete class implementation.

## Check Xaml Nodes Resolve
Checks that xml nodes map to a .NET symbol and can be either compiled or inflated.

**Available Fixes**

 * **Generate Missing Value Converter**: When a Xaml node cannot be resolved and it ends with '[cC]onverter', this fix will create a new implemenation of IValueConverter.
 * **Generate Missing View**: When a Xaml node cannot be resolved, this fix will create a new implemenation of that class deriving from 'Xamarin.Forms.View'.
 * **Generate Missing Class**: When a Xaml node cannot be resolved, this fix will create a new implementation of that class.
 * **Replace node with auto-corrected match**: This fix action replaces a mispelt xaml node that can be resolved in an assembly with its correct .NET symbol name.

## Class does not have attached property
Checks that attached properties (for example 'Grid.Row') exist in the class that they are attempting to use.

**Available Fixes**

 * **Replace with correct attached property name**: Replaces an incorrect attached property with an auto-corrected value.

## Duplicate AutomationIds
Inspects a Xaml document for duplicate AutomationId's

## Duplicate Code Behind Field Declarations
Checks that the value assigned to an x:Name attribute for a Xaml element is unique within the scope of the document.

## Duplicate resource dictionary keys
Validates the each resource entry within a resource dictionary has a unique key

## Event Handler Exists In Code Behind Class
Checks that an event callback reference as an attribute value within a xaml document exists in the code behind class.

**Available Fixes**

 * **Generate event handler method**: Generates a method body for an event handler that does not exist in the xaml files code-behind class.

## Event Handler Signature Matches
Checks that the signature for the event callback in a code behind class matches the expected signature for the property it is assigned to.

## Find x:TypeArguments misuse
Inspects for usages of x:TypeArguments on elements that look like they resolve to non-generic classes

## Generic has x:TypeArguments supplied.
Inspects generic classes being instantiated through Xaml and validates that an x:TypeArguments attribute or property assignment node is present.

**Available Fixes**

 * **Create x:TypeArguments attribute.**: Generates an x:TypeArguments attribute, resolving the potential argument types if possible.
 * **Create x:TypeArguments property setter**: Generates a child 'x:TypeArguments' property setter node, resolving the potential argument types if possible.

## Obsolete Property Used
Checks for attributes that are marked as obsolete/deprecated.

## OnIdiom Return Type Mismatch
Checks the type returned by a Xamarin.Forms.OnIdiom element is valid with the parent property type

## OnPlatform Return Type Mismatch
Checks the type returned by a Xamarin.Forms.OnPlatform element is valid with the parent property type

## Property Node Maps To Member In Parent Type
Checks that a property node resolves to a member within its parent type.

## Property Setter Attribute Has Value
Checks that a value has been provided to an attribute Property. This check is skipped if the property type is a string or a valueconverter is in use.

## Property Setter Attribute Has Value
Checks that a value has been provided to a node Property setter (MyClass.MyProperty).

## Property Setter Node Misuse
Inspects for property setters that don't apply to the outer class. For example, if a developer used OnIdiom.Phone inside a OnPlatform element, the OnIdiom.Phone property setter makes no sense within the given context.

## Property Setter Type Mismatch
When using MyClass.MyProperty node setter syntax, validate that the inner child node returns a .NET object of the correct type for the property.

## Resource entry does not define a key
Validates the elements provided to a resource dictionary supply an x:Key attribute

**Available Fixes**

 * **Remove unused xmlns declaration**: Removes the unused xmlns declaration.

## Undefined Static Resource Usage
Validates that a static resource lookup resolves to a resource defined in the xaml file.

**Available Fixes**

 * **Autocorrect static resource reference**: When a static resource reference does not exist in the current document but a closely named symbol exists, this fix allows 

## Unknown Static Property Value
Checks that the literal value provided to xml attributes which accept a class object maps to a static property or field in the class type. For example, the LayoutOptions class has static fields such as Fill or CentreAndExpand that can be used a literal attribute values. If CentreAndFill was provided, this analyser would inspect 'LayoutOptions' for a static field named 'CentreAndFill' and trigger an analysis error when it couldn't be found.

**Available Fixes**

 * **Replace unknown property value with autocorrection**: When a xaml element property attempts to reference a static field (for instance LayoutOptions.Center), this fix finds the nearest named member and replaces the incorrect value with an auto-correction.

## Unknown type provided to generic
Inspects usages of x:TypeArguments and validates that the type provided exists

## Unused Code Behind Field
Checks that a code behind field declaration (x:Name) is used within the project in either C# or Xaml.

## Validate Binding Expression Return Type
Validates that the .NET symbol returned by a binding expression matches the expected type for the property.

## Validate Binding Expressions Return A Property
Evaluates a binding expression and validates that it points to property within the binding context.

**Available Fixes**

 * **Replace field or method reference with property.**: Replaces a field or method symbol within a binding expression with a suggested property name.

## Validate StaticResource Return Type
Validates that the symbol returned by an StaticResource matches the expected type for the property.

## Validate Value Types
Inspects the input provided to attributes that expect value types (int, bool, double etc) and validates that the input is valid.

## Validate x:Static return type
Validates that the .NET symbol returned by an x:Static matches the expected type for the property.

## Validate xmlns declarations are used.
Validates that an xmlns attribute that declares a namespace and assembly is used within the current document.

**Available Fixes**

 * **Remove unused xmlns declaration**: Removes the unused xmlns declaration.

## Value Converter Input Type Mismatch
Inspects the Converter property of a Binding expression and validates that the input type is correct.

## Value Converter Output Type Mismatch
The Converter component of a Binding expression and validates that the returned output type is valid for the parent attribute.

## x:Name Has Invalid Characters
Checks that x:Name expressions define a valid code-behind variable name. An value declared by an x:Name attribute must start with a @, _ or a-Z character followed by underscores or alpha-numeric characters.

## x:Reference element exists
Checks that the element referenced by a 'x:Reference' xaml expression exists within the current document.

**Available Fixes**

 * **Replace x:Name with closely named member**: Replaces an invalid x:Name reference with a similiarly named x:Name declared in the current document.

## Xml Namespace Does Not Resolve
Checks that the namespace used on the xml nodes is defined within the current document.

**Available Fixes**

 * **Import namespace and assembly**: When an xaml node can be resolved to a .NET symbol in the project or its references this fix generates an 'xmlns' import statement in the root xaml element.
 * **Replace xml namespace with auto-correction**: Replaces an xml namespace prefix with the auto-corrected xml namespace.

## Xmlns Assembly Does Not Resolve
Checks that the 'assembly' component of an xmlns statement resolves to an assembly referenced by the project.

## Xmlns declaration is malformed
Verifies that a 'xmlns' attribute has both a clr-namespace and an assembly component
